This Springer imprint is published by the registered company Springer Nature Switzerland AG The registered company address is: Gewerbestrasse 11, 6330 Cham, Switzerland This book is dedicated to my wife, Áine, who is my greatest supporter and greatest critique. Acknowledgements A textbook such as this came about as a result of collaboration with many colleagues in general practice (GP), dermatology and plastic surgery over the past 38 years since I qualified in medicine in Dublin, and even before that as an undergraduate studying medicine in UCD. I learnt the meaning of hard work, empathy and passion from my parents and particularly my father, Dr Denis Buckley, who was a GP with an interest in dermatology in our local town for over 50 years. His motto was “work hard and play hard” which I try to follow. My mentors in GP training in Dublin including Prof Fergus O Kelly, Dr Manne Berber, Prof Bill Shannon and Prof Andrew Murphy all instilled in me a love of general practice. I spent 18 months working in hospital-based dermatology in Dublin after qualifying in medicine and received excellent teaching from some of the top Irish dermatologists at the time including Prof Sarah Rogers, Prof Frank Powell and Dr Sean O’Loughlin. My 2 years working in a rural mission hos- pital in “the bush” in Northern Kenya allowed me a wonderful opportunity to improve my surgical skills and knowledge of tropical medicine that was mostly learnt from my Kenyan doctor and nurse collogues to whom I am eternally grateful. I spent a year studying for the Diploma in Practical Dermatology in the University of Wales College of Medicine in the early 1990s and got a wonder- ful, structured education from some of the top UK dermatologists at the time including Prof Ronny Marks and Prof Andrew Finley. All my colleagues in the Primary Care Dermatology Society of Ireland (PCDSI), the Primary Care Dermatology Society (PCDS, UK), the Primary Care Surgical Association (PCSA) and the Association of Surgeons in Primary Care (ASPC, UK) have been wonderful support and encouragement to me over the years. Many of my colleagues and friends in these organisa- tions (too many to mention individually—you know who you are) helped proofread all the chapters in this book. Particular word of thanks to Dr Johnny Loughnane and Dr Hilda Fennell O’Shea with whom I established the PCDSI and Dr Niall Maguire and Dr Tony O’Sullivan with whom I established the PCSA. Thanks also to my UK collogues who have encouraged and supported me over the years, especially Dr Laurel Spooner, Mr Vijay Kumar, Dr Jonathan Botting, all from the ASPC, and Mr Christy Chou from the PCDS. I have made many friends and met wonderfully supportive colleagues through the International Society of Cryosurgery (ISC) including Dr Gloria vii viii Acknowledgements Graham, Prof Christos C. Zouboulis, Dr Arthur Jackson and Mr Omar Maiwand. Thanks to all my GP colleagues in Kerry and in the South West Specialist Training Programme in General Practice who have supported me over the years and trusted me to look after many of their patients with difficult derma- tology problems. No man is an island and I could not work without the cooperation and sup- port of my hospital-based colleagues in dermatology, plastic surgery and pathology in both Kerry and Cork. My patients in GP and primary care dermatology have taught me so much, and their feedback and encouragement have maintained my interest and enthusiasm in these areas of medicine which I hope will continue for many years to come. Dr Paola Pasquali deserves special mention. She has been a friend and mentor over many years, and I am delighted to have her expert opinions and support in writing this textbook. A special word of thanks to all at Springer Books, especially Vijayasankara Gomathy Rajagopal, Leo Johnson and Grant Weston who have all been patient and supportive over the past few months in preparing the final manu- script for publication. Finally, I would like to thank my wife Áine and my 3 children who have put up with me over the past number of years with my head stuck in the laptop writing and rewriting draft after draft. Áine is my greatest critic and sup- porter. She has read every line of this textbook, checking for grammar and spelling errors that were all too frequent. I could not have done any of this without her love, support and encouragement. 25 May 2020 David Buckley Contents Part I Overview 1 Dermatology in Primary Care . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

practice and GP trainer who has developed a special interest and expertise in dermatology and skin surgery. He obtained his basic medical degree from the National University of Ireland (Dublin) in 1982. He joined the Dublin Vocational Training Scheme in General Practice in 1983 and spent the next 3 years specialising in general practice which included 6 months in the dermatology department of the Mater Hospital, Dublin. After this, he spent 6 months training at the Dublin Skin and Cancer Hospital, Hume Street, Dublin. Dr Buckley then spent 2 years working as the chief medical officer in a large mission hospital in the north of Kenya with APSO (the Irish development agency) where he per- fected his skills in surgery and tropical medicine. On return to Ireland in 1989, Dr Buckley established a new general practice combined with a pri- mary care dermatology practice in his hometown of Tralee. Having begun on his own, the practice has since grown to include five doctors, three nurses, a clinical assistant and seven administration staff. He completed a year-long Diploma in Practical Dermatology in the University of Wales College of Medicine in 1990. He established the Solas Dermatology and Laser Clinic 2000 and changed the name to the Kerry Skin Clinic in 2018. Dr Buckley is a founding member of the Primary Care Dermatology Society of Ireland (1996) and the Primary Care Surgical Society (2012). He has been a member of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology since 1993. He has published eight scientific papers on community-based dermatology and cryo- surgery in peer-reviewed journals, and this is his second book on primary care dermatology. He has also contributed chapters on two international textbooks on cryosurgery. He is an honorary lecturer in dermatology for the Irish College of General Practitioners and was awarded a fellowship of the Royal College of General Practitioners (London) in 2018 for his contribution to medicine. Paola Pasquali is a dermatologist with a specialty in non-melanoma skin cancer treatment with special emphasis on cryosurgery, non-invasive imaging techniques and teledermatology. She is a Springer editor for Skin Cancer: A Practical Approach, Cryosurgery: A Practical Manual and Photography in Clinical Medicine. She is Past President of the International Society of Teledermatology and chairman of AAD International Affairs Committee and member of EADV School. xv Part I Overview 1 Dermatology in Primary Care David Buckley Key Points public health nurse or community pharmacist [1].

Teledermatology will further help GP’s in getting advice on cases where there is no certainty. The diagnosis and treatment of most derma- tology problems rarely requires complicated or expensive imaging modalities such as CT scans or operating theatres with general anaesthesia. Treatment usually involves simple topical or oral treatments and many lumps and bumps can easily be excised or removed with basic surgical skills that are well within the scope of many GPs once the correct diagnosis is confirmed.

On follow up, after initiating treatment, it is helpful to ask the patient if their skin condition is the “same, better or worse” than their last visit. Sometimes it is useful to score the improvement (e.g. 25%, 50%, 75% or 90% better).

Discussing cases with colleagues within the practice may help, as they may recall seeing a similar case previously. Published and “on line” dermatology atlases can be a very useful way of learning the appearance of common rashes and lesions. Artificial intelli- gence (AI) is already available to aid diagnosis using algorithms and photos in dermoscopy and will become more available in the future [2].

The usual clinical features are oily skin with open and closed comedones (black- heads and whiteheads) (Fig. 7.4a, b) (Fig. 7.5). These features are known as non-i nflammatory Fig. 7.1 Picker’s acne in a 17 year old and may be all that is found in mild disease. Comedones may be large and obvious or tiny and only visible with a magnifying lense (micro- comedones). More moderate acne will have signs of inflammation with papules and pustules dis- tribute on the face, neck, chest or back (Fig. 7.6). More severe acne may have nodules and cysts which may result in acne scaring (Table 7.1) (Fig. 7.7). When the sebaceous content of the over- grown sebaceous gland is exposed to air, it gets oxidated, blackens and it is called a blackhead. When the gland is closed by skin, the sebaceous content maintains its color and it is called a Fig. 7.2 Nodulocystic acne pre-oral isotretinoin in a 19-year-old patient whitehead. 7 A Stepwise Approach to the Management of Acne in Primary Care 37 a b Fig. 7.3 Permanent acne scars (a) Acne scars before microneedling; (b) same patient after 4 sessions of microneedling using the dermapen When treating a patient with acne, it is impor- The non inflammatory and inflammatory fea- tant to know: tures of acne may be found in certain patterns on the face, chest and back (e.g. T-zone, muzzle • When did it first appeared? area, jaw line and neck, etc.).

Buckley a (a) Excessive production of sebum (under hor- monal control) (b) Follicular plugging causing micro- comedones and comedones. (c) Overgrowth of micro-organisms especially Cutibacterium acnes (C acnes, formerly Propionibacterium acnes) which causes releases of inflammatory cytokines (d) Inflammation causes the pylosebaceous unit wall to ruptures resulting in an intense for- b eign body like reaction which leads to further development of inflammatory lesions (pap- ules, pustules, nodules, cysts). The problem with acne is that the end organ (the pilosebaceous unit) is very sensitive to the normal fluctuations of hormones that occur in adolescence and young adults leading to increased sebum production. This may be geneti- cally determined. While it is clear hormones (especially androgens) play a major rose in aeti- ology of acne, almost all patients will have nor- mal hormonal levels in their blood. The only exception is patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

Pyoderma faciale is a rare pustular eruption that occurs on the face in young women (Fig. 7.17). It usually starts suddenly and can be very severe with nodules or cysts and can leave scars. Unlike acne, there are usually no comedones or oily skin. It does not affect the trunk and does not occur in men. It usually responds to high dose anti- acne treatments such as tetralyclines, trim- ethoprim or isotretinoin. Large cysts may need to be drained and injected with interalesional ste- roids. Oral steroids may be necessary in severe inflammatory cases. Once cleared it usually does not relapse. Acne fulminans is a very rare, severe form of nodulocystic acne where the inflammatory process is so severe there is usually systemic symptoms Fig. 7.16 Acne pre “Dianette®” with topical adapaline such as a low grade fever, flu-like symptoms and and benzoyl peroxide in an 18 year old woman arthralgia.

After clearing up the clinical signs of acne, the patient should be maintained on a long term topical treatment to prevent relapse for as long as they have a tendency towards acne.

Because it Not only will it clear severe acne, it usually cures works on all the levels in the pathogenesis of acne permanently in approximately three quarters acne, it can be used as a monotherapy and no (72%) of patients who complete a course [1]. topical acne treatments are required. The summary of product characteristics in Ireland states that, “isotretinoin should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physi- cians with experience in the use of systemic reti- noids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements”. This usually means that only doctors who have worked in a dermatology department for at least 6–12 months would have the experience required to prescribe it. Some GPs may have built up experience in prescribing isotretinoin over the years in practice. In New Zealand, registered GPs working in an appropriate field have been allowed prescribe isotretinoin since 2009 subject to Special Authority. From the years 2001–2012, 58% of prescriptions for isotretinoin in New Zealand originated in general practice [2]. 8.3 Side Effects “Roaccutane®” is highly teratogenic and so a hor- monal contraceptive is compulsory for all women Fig. 8.1 Severe acne in a 17-year-old girl pre-oral of child bearing age, even those who are not cur- isotretinoin rently sexually active (young teenagers, nuns, etc.).

Approximately one in five patients (22%) may develop more severe acne post oral isotretinoin that may require a second course [1] (Figs. 8.6 and 8.7).

Bromohydrosis (smelly sweating) can often make the problem even more troublesome for the patient. Many are reluctant to seek medical help in the mistaken belief that nothing can be done. Idiopathic focal hyperhidrosis usually starts in childhood although many patients delay seeking medical help until they reach adult life. Between a third and half of the patients have a positive family history. Interestingly, idiopathic focal hyperhidrosis does not cause excessive sweating during sleep. Hyperhidrosis is usually diagnosed clini- cally. If the presentation is characteristic of primary focal hyperhidrosis and there is no evidence of an underlying cause, no laboratory tests are required. If there is a suspicion of sec- ondary hyperhydrosis due to some medical condition special tests and investigations may be required (Table 12.2). There are various methods to quantify the amount of sweat being produced on the palms Fig. 12.1 Hyperhidrosis of the feet or axilla such as gravimetric measurement.

Pityriasis Rosea Tinea corporis Numular (discoid) eczema 13.2 Clinical Features Conact allergic dermatitis Drug rash and Diagnosis Ichthyosis Molloscum dermatitis Atopic eczema is a dry, itchy skin condition (see Dermatitis herpetiformis Table 13.1). If there is little or no itch then you Ichthyosis should reconsider the diagnosis (see Table 13.2). Most of the clinical features of atopic eczema arise as a consequence of scratching itchy, dry skin. Scratching further compromises the skin barrier function. Therefore, all treatments should be aimed at breaking the itch-scratch cycle. This is primarily achieved by moisturising the skin with the appropiate moisturisers, avoiding soaps and other irritants and targeted therapies with top- ical calcineurin inhibitors and or topical steroids. Table 13.1 Diagnostic criteria for atopic eczema Must have: An itchy skin condition (or report of scratching or rubbing in a child) Plus three or more of the following: a. History of itchiness in skin creases such as folds of the elbows, behind the knees, fronts of ankles, or around neck (or cheeks in children under 4 years). b. History of asthma or hay fever (or history of atopic disease in a first degree relative in children under 4 years). c. General dry skin in the past year. d.

More severe cases can have generalised dry red itchy skin affection most of the body, face and scalp (Fig. 13.4). Infraorbital folds (Dennie-Morgan folds) are common in patients with AE (25% of patients) and may occur as the eyelids are a site of predilection for AE causing typical extra lines or skin folds under the eyes. Paradoxically, the nappy area in children is often spared. There may be a number of reasons for this.

Molluscum infection can cause an entering the system through a defective skin inflammatory reaction resulting in molluscum barrier. 13 Atopic Eczema in Children 87 13.5 Treatment The management of AE is multi factorial and will require a combination of non- prescription and prescription items to tackle the various underly- ing factors including itch, dry sensitive skin, infections and allergies. Because atopic eczema is a chronic disease, the doctor must have strategies for treating acute exacerbations and also for maintenance treatment between exacerbations. Parents need to under- stand that AE is a chronic condition and they will need to apply treatment depending on the extend of the rash and the severity of the disease at pre- sentation (mild, moderate or severe). The corner stone of treatment is “The 3 E’s” 1. Emollients 2. Education of the child and parents on man- agement of AE 3. Elimination of irritants, allergens and itch. Advice should be given with regards to cloth- ing, feeding, bedroom decor, entertainments like sun bathing and swimming pools. For instance, AD children should avoid sleeping in rooms with Fig. 13.5 Infected atopic eczema many books, rugs or any other dust attracting material (like curtains). Frequent vacuuming is recommended, washing of curtains, leave books out of the room and maintain correct level of humidity. Air allergens may be a trigger for an exacerbation of AD. Avoiding them can be useful for secondary prevention. 13.6 Skin Infection Regardless of the severity of the presentation, all children with atopic eczema should be assessed for signs of clinical infection. Eczema is a dry, itchy skin condition. If the skin is crusty, weepy or sore then it is most likely infected, usually with Staphylococcus aureus (Figs. 13.5 and 13.6). Staphylococcus aureus is commensal in 10% of children who have no skin problems but is found in up to 90% of children with atopic eczema. If it penetrates intact skin as a result of a defective skin barrier function and or scratching, it can cause clinical infection that can resemble impetigo (impetiginised eczema). Once there is Fig. 13.6 Infected atopic eczema on the face 88 D. Buckley clinical infection no treatment will work until the 13.7 Moisturisers infection is cleared.

Buckley generalised or localised (see Chap. 36 on regional dermatology for localised eczema/dermatitis management). The stepwise approach to the management of dermatitis in adults (Fig. 14.8) is similar to that in children (See Chap. 13—Atopic eczema in chil- dren). In adults, potent topical steroids like beta- methasone (“Betnovate®”) and sometimes very potent topical steroids like clobetasol propionate (“Dermovate®”) can be used on the body (but not on the face). 14.6 Emollients Topical steroids will do nothing for dry skin. The first step in the management of dermatitis is always to moisturise liberally with a safe, greasy, cheap moisturiser. The best moisturiser is the greasiest one that the patient is willing to use.

It is impor- tant to reduce to a less potent topical steroid as the dermatitis improves (see Chap. 63 on topical ste- roids). “Haelan tape®”, which contains a moder- ately potent topical steroid impregnated into the tape, can be useful for fissures on the feet or hands. Wet wraps, as described in Chap. 13 for children, can also be used in adults and special wet wrap garments are available in adult sizes. As the skin is such an accessible organ for topical therapies, it is rare to have to resort to oral steroids for the management of dermatitis in gen- eral practice (see Chap. 63). 14.9 Anti-histamines Histamine is not primarily involved in the patho- physiology of dermatitis and so non-sedating antihistamines do not usually help.

Buckley to be referred to a dermatologist for ultraviolet light, oral treatment or systemic therapy. 15.2 Clinical Features and Diagnosis Psoriasis is diagnosed clinically as there is no definitive blood test and the histological features can be similar to other skin conditions. Psoriasis is considered mild in 60% of patients, moderate in 30% and severe in 10%. There are many different types of psoriasis (Table 15.1), the most common being chronic plaque psoriasis (Fig. 15.1). This causes well defined, red plaques that are covered with silvery scale. Plaques are distributed over characteristic body sites such as the extensor sur- faces of the knees and elbows, the lower back and the scalp (Figs. 15.2 and 15.3). It can occur on any part of the body and itch may occur but is usually mild, unlike atopic eczema where the itch is severe. Nail changes are common and can be used as a clue to the diagnosis in atypical cases. Fig. 15.1 Chronic plaque psoriasis in a 44-year-old male The most common psoriatic nail changes are onycholysis (lifting of the nail from the nail bed with subungual debris under the distal end of the nails) (Fig. 15.4), thickening and nail pitting (small dints on the surface of the nail plate as if they were scored with a pin) (Fig. 15.5). These occur in up to 50% of patients with psoriasis. Pitting can also be present in eczema and alope- cia areata. Psoriatic nail changes can occasion- ally occur in isolation and it is sometimes necessary to send nail clippings to the lab for fun- gal stain and culture to distinguish psoriatic nails from tinea unguium.

Some patients can get one, self limiting break out of the rash which may never recur again. Others can have chronic or relapsing flare-ups of their pso- riasis all their life. Psoriasis may be very limited and mild in some patients, yet extensive and severe in others. Although there is as yet no cure for psoriasis, almost all patients can be managed by simple topical treatments at home while some require hospital based treatment such as UVL or systemic therapies. The improved understanding of the pathophysiology of psoriasis has led to the Fig. 15.17 Plantar psoriasis on a patient with palmoplan- development of a number of targeted biological tar psoriasis treatments which are extremely effective.

It is an inflamma- tory process and there are usually small papules Fig. 17.2 Rosacea in a 49 year old and pustules confined to the face.

Buckley 17.7 Cellulitis and Erysipelas Bacterial infections of the skin can occur on any part of the body including the face. Cellulitis is a deep-seated infection of the skin that may be associated with systemic flu-like symptoms and a fever. It has all the usual hallmarks of infection with redness, heat, tenderness and swelling. The rash usually spreads outwards from its origins which is usually a small scrape or cut in the skin which allows the organism (which is often a com- mensal) into deeper layers of the skin. Cellulitis is usually caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (2/3 of cases) or Staphylococcus aureus (1/3 of cases). Treatment is normally with flucloxacillin, either orally or intravenously for 10–14 days. With more severe cellulitis, benzoyl penicillin (peni- cillin g) or oral penicillin (penicillin v) may need to be given in addition to flucloxacillin. Erysipelas (also know as St Anthony’s fire) is a similar infection to cellulitis but usually occurs on a more superficial plane in the skin and so there is a more obvious firm, red, raised, well defined border than in cellulitis. However, it can Fig. 17.3 Steroid rosacea in an 11-year-old child using be difficult to distinguish erysipelas from celluli- hydrocortisone butyrate cream on the face. (“Locoid®”) tis clinically.

It is usually asymptomatic but causes problems due to cosmetic appearance. It nor- mally resolves in adolescence or early adult life. Exfoliating with sponges and washes can help.

Pasquali (eds.), Textbook of Primary Care Dermatology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29101-3_18 134 D. Buckley is more like acne than dermatitis and often responds to acne therapies such as topical or oral antibiotics. Unlike perioral eczema, with perioral dermatitis there is normally a rim of uninvolved skin between the rash and the vermilion border of the lip (Fig. 18.1). The rash can be asymmetrical and can occur on only one side of the upper lip or chin or any combination of these areas (Fig. 18.2). More severe cases can spread all the way around the mouth. Some patients can have a Fig. 18.3 Periocular dermatitis (around the eyelids) in a micro-papular rash below and lateral to the lower female who was putting betamethasone valerate on her face eyelid on one or both sides (periocular dermati- tis) (Fig. 18.3).

Alternatively, the frequency of appli- to be stopped with the risk of a rebound flare and cation of the topical steroid can be reduced grad- worsening of the rash in the first 2 weeks; the ually over 2 weeks. Treatment is usually with oral antibiotics that have a strong anti inflammatory effect such as lymecycline, doxycycline or a erythro- mycin for 1–2 months in a dose similar to the one used for acne. Milder cases may respond to topical antibiotics such as erythromycin, clindamycin or metronidazole gel. Other topi- cal agents that have been tried include azelaic acid (“Skinorin®”) or topical calcineurin inhib- itors (tacrolimus). 18.4 Steroid Rosacea Fig. 18.1 Peri orofacial dermatitis in a 51-year-old woman Using potent topical steroids on the face over a number of weeks or months can lead to steroid damage (thinning and redness of the skin) and sometimes steroid rosacea. This can look and behave like classical rosacea but normally clears up once the steroid is stopped. Steroids are prob- ably best stopped gradually as sudden withdrawal will result in a severe flare of the steroid rosacea. As the steroid is gradually reduced in potency and frequency of application over a few weeks, topical and oral rosacea therapies should be com- menced and continued until all papules and pus- Fig. 18.2 Perioral dermatitis in a 42-year-old woman who was putting betamethasone valerate on her face tules are cleared (see Chap. 10). 18 Papulo-Pustular Rashes on the Face 135 18.5 Folliculitis 18.7 Pseudofolliculitis Barbae (Razor Bumps, Shaving Rash) This can cause papules and pustules affecting the hair follicles most commonly on the beard and This normally occurs on the side of the neck but moustache area in men (Sycosis barbae).

Acute • Is there arthralgia or myalgia (autoimmune?) urticaria is much more common in children and young adults and is frequently the result of a viral infection, NSAIDs or after eating too much fruit or coloured sweets. Classical generalised urticaria with the typical wheal-flare type rash can be divided into acute urticaria, which last less than 6 weeks and chronic urticaria which lasts more than 6 weeks but can often last months or years. Acute urticaria can be provoked by simple viral infections such as an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or tonsillitis. Other common causes, particularly in children, are medications, both prescribed and over-the-counter medication (e.g.; aspirin or NSAIDs). Fortunately, acute urticaria responds quickly to the new generation, non-sedating, oral antihistamines either in syrup or tablet form. The older, first generation, sedating antihistamines such as chlorphenamine maleate 4 mg (“Piriton”®) or promethazine (“Phenegran”®) can be useful when given at night if the itch is keeping the patient awake, by virtue of the sedating effects. Chronic urticaria can be more difficult to manage.

Almost all drugs can cause urti- caria but Table 20.4 lists the most common offenders. The urticarial rash may occur immedi- ately on starting the drug or may develop months or years after being on the offending drug (e.g. ACE inhibitors or the combined oral contracep- tive pill). There are many types of chronic urti- caria that can be provoked by various physical and chemical factors (Table 20.5).

It is also important to identify infectious rashes that may pose a threat to others especially pregnant women. Childhood exanthems (Chap. 27), pregnancy rashes (Chap. 25) and blistering eruptions (Chap. 23) will be covered in their respective chapters. 22.3 Differential Diagnosis Difficult to diagnose rashes may sometimes be managed by symptomatic treatment and review after a few weeks where clues in history or more classical clinical features of a particular rash may become more apparent. Other rashes may need investigations or referral depending on these symp- toms, the risk of serious underlying pathology and the patient’s ideas, concerns and expectations. Many patients with an acute generalised, maculo-p apular rash with no symptoms improve spontaneously or with simple measures such as emollients and avoiding soaps and other irritants, (e.g. guttate psoriasis, viral rashes).

Treatment can be difficult Fig. 22.6 Nodular prurigo (Prurigo Nodularis) 172 D. Buckley Generalised folliculitis can be caused by infection, occlusion, irritation, drugs or various skin diseases.

Spa pool (jacuzzi) folliculitis is usually doe to pseudomo- nas aeruginosa and usually clears spontaneously once the patient stays away from the pool. More severe resistant cases may need treatment with oral ciprofloxacin. Yeast infections such as malassezia folliculitis is caused by Pityrosporum ovale and usually presents as a monomorphic, acne like eruption on the chest and upper back. It is more common in patients who are overweight, have Down’s syndrome or who are immunosuppressed (e.g. diabetes, HIV, obesity, pregnancy). It sometimes occurs after a course of oral broad spectrum anti- biotics or oral steroids. Swabs may fail to isolate the yeast and a skin biopsy may be necessary to make the diagnosis.

On close examination there 2 days in a farmer maybe tiny inflamed blood vessels and light bruising. Sometimes the rash is painful or burn- ing rather than itchy. Petechiae (small spots of bleeding under the skin) may appear. Some patients may have systemic symptoms such as joint pains, fever, abdominal pains, lymphadeno- padhy or photosensitivity. Diagnosis is usually made by a skin biopsy. Treatment can be symp- tomatic with anti-histamines and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory. More troublesome cases of urticarial vasculitis require Dapsone, colchicine, anti-malarial, oral steroids or other immunosup- pressive agents (see Chap. 54).

Another common cause of local bullae is drug photoallergic reactions which may happen after several days of exposure to sun.

The eccrine sweat glands shrink as we get older and the pilosebaceous units produce less oil resulting in dry skin. This is why acne is rare in the elderly but eczema is more common. The Langerhans cells decrease, affecting the immune responsive- ness of the skin. This can lead to the decline in cell mediated immunity, resulting in problems such as skin cancers and shingles.

It is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. It usually presents as an asymmetrical ‘’sore” with a yellowy gold coloured crust and exudate on exposed areas. It can spread to other parts of the body and to other children. As is it contagious, careful hand wash- ing and using a separate towel for the infected child is important to protect the rest of the family. The crusty plaques are usually round, oozing and expand as the infection progresses. Milder cases will usually respond to topical antibiotics such as fusidic acid cream (“Fucidin Cream®”), which should be applied after gently removing the crust with an antiseptic wash. All orifices of the body should be treated regardless of impetigo location to ensure a focus for re-i nfection is cleared.

The rash usually starts on the face and behind the ears on the fourth or fifth day of the febrile illness and quickly becomes more generalised while sparing the palms and the soles. The rash begins to fade with fine brown scales after 3 or 4 days. Diagnosis is usually made for public health reasons using a viral nasopharyngeal swab and throat swabs for polymerase chain reaction. Blood can also be checked for measles IgM and IgG antibodies. Treatment is usually symptomatic with sup- portive measures and isolation of the child at home or in hospital, if required. An infected child is contagious from 2 days before any symptoms develop to at least 5 days after the onset of the rash. The incubation period is usually from 7 to 14 days. 27.4 Rubella Rubella (German measles) is a far less serious ill- Fig. 27.1 Chickenpox in a 9-year-old boy ness than measles.

It is most common from the age of 2–10 years old. It usually has a 1–4 days incubation period. Older children usually develop lifelong protec- tive antibodies against the streptococcal toxins. Scarlet fever usually starts with a fever, sore throat, swollen, red, strawberry tongue and a flu-like illness. The scarlet blotches usually develop on the second day of the illness and progress to give a sunburn appearance with pal- pable goose pimples (sandpaper texture). The classic red streaks (pastia lines) may appear in the folds of skin especially in the axillae and antecubital fossa. Scarlet fever usually responds to oral or intravenous Penicillin V or Erythromycin if the child is allergic to penicil- lin. The fever and constitutional symptoms should settle quickly with treatment and long- term complications from streptococcal toxins such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis Fig. 27.2 Infectious mononucleosis and a morbiliform are fortunately rare. The rash fades with peeling rash as a result of the patient being given amoxacillin over the following few days or weeks. 216 D. Buckley Although this presents like a drug rash, it is not a a true drug allergy and will not reoccur if the patient gets the same antibiotic at a later date when he/she does not have glandular fever. This is one of the reasons why children with sore throat requiring antibiotics should be given peni- cillin V and not amoxicillin. Glandular fever is usually confirmed by doing a blood test for a monospot which is pos- itive. A lymphocytosis can be found. The treat- ment is usually symptomatic, although prolonged fatigue for weeks or months can occur in some cases. 27.11 Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease This is a mild and short lived viral infection that most often occurs in children under the age of 5. It usually presents with blisters on the hands, feet and mouth (Fig. 27.3a, b). Clusters can occur within a family or school. It is caused by an enterovirus infection, usually coxsackievirus A16. The incubation period is usually 3–5 days b when the child then develops a mild fever, sore throat and a flu-like illness. Pink patches develop on the front and back of the hands and feet, which are quickly followed by small greyish blisters. The rash usually resolves without scar- ring within a week. Small mouth ulcers may result in loss of appetite. Treatment is non-spe- cific and symptomatic with analgesia, good skin care and a soft diet. Good hand washing tech- niques will reduce the spread of the disease. Stools can be infective for up to a month after the illness. Infected children should be kept away from pregnant women. A recent coxsackievirus A6-associated enterovirus outbreak in Ireland was responsible for a potentially more widespread, severe, and varied disease than classic hand foot and mouth disease. This is known as eczema coxsackium and can be confused with bullous impetigo, eczema herpeticum, vasculitis, and primary immunobullous disease. It is more common in children with atopic eczema. These children usually have an extensive rash with widespread Fig. 27.3 (a) Hand foot and mouth disease.

Buckley 28.3 Neurofibromatosis This is a relatively common autosomal dominant condition but almost 50% of cases have no family history. It occurs in 1 in 3000 people. There are two main types of neurofibromatosis (type 1 and type 2): 28.3.1 Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (von-Recklinghausen’s = NF1) NF1 represents 85% of all cases. It is a rare (1 in 4000 births) autosomal domi- nant disease characterised by the presence of two or more of the following: (a) Six or more café-au-lait spots greater than 5 cm in pre-pubertal children and greater than 15 cm in adults (b) Axillary or inguinal freckling (70% of cases) (c) Two or more neurofibromas (d) Two or more Lisch nodules (small circle pig- mented iris hamartomas—best seen with a Fig. 28.1 Neurofibromatosis type 1 slit lamp)—(90% of cases) (e) Optic glioma depicted in the movie “The Elephant Man”.

The usual age of first symptoms (i.e. hearing and balance problems) is around 20-years of age (range 2–52) and cata- racts are present in 80% of the cases. 28.4 Tuberous Sclerosis Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant dis- order of hamartoma formation in many organs especially in skin, brain, eyes, kidney and heart. It is uncommon with an incidence of 1 in 10,000. Approximately 60–70% of cases are thought to be new mutations. The typical skin lesions are as follows: (a) Angiofibromas—these usually appear from the age of 3–10 years old. They are firm, dis- creet, reddish brown, telangectatic papules ranging from 1 mm to 10 mm in diameter on the cheeks and chin and often mistaken for acne (Fig. 28.2). (b) Shagreen patch—this is an irregular, thick, macular, papular, soft skin coloured plaque Fig. 28.2 Tuberous sclerosis with tiny angiofibroma on usually in the lumbo-sacral area that causes the nose no symptoms (Fig. 28.3) (c) Periungual fibromas—these appear at or after puberty as smooth, firm, fleshy, warty benign growths arising from the proximal nail folds and can grow to 5 mm or 10 mm long (Fig. 28.4a, b). (d) Ash leaf-shaped white macules—these are white ovoid macules measuring 1–3 cm usu- ally on the trunk or limbs (Fig. 28.5). They are usually the first cutaneous sign of tuber- ous sclerosis. They may be present at birth or shortly after and can be a clue to the diagno- sis in a child with epilepsy. However, these macules are often seen in normal babies Fig. 28.3 Tuberous sclerosis with a Shagreen patch without tuberous sclerosis. 60–70% of patients with tuberous sclerosis birth or develop in adolescence or early adult life. will have epilepsy, intellectual disabilities and Tumours may also occur in the heart, kidney, developmental delay which may be present from lungs, GI tract and brains. 222 D.

Patients often have a family history of Darier’s disease. They usually present in late childhood or in early adult life with greasy, scaly papules on the face and trunk in a sebor- rhoeic dermatitis pattern.

Buckley 29.2 Congenital Vascular Lesions Naevus simplex is the most common congenital nevus seen in children. It is usually due to a minor vascular malformation. It presents as faint, flat, pink capillaries on the back of the neck (Nevus Flammeus Nuchae or “stork bits”), eyelids or the forehead (“angel’s kiss”) (Fig. 29.1). It occurs in approximately a third of all children. The ones on the face usually fades after a year or two. No treatment is necessary and the parents should be reassured they fade spontaneously as the child gets older. Nevus Flammeus Nuchae may persist into adult life. Strawberry Haemangioma (capillary hae- mangiomas) occur in almost 10% of children and are more common in girls, in premature babies, low birth weight babies, twins and triplets. They are due to a benign tumour of the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels causing an abnor- mal collection of normal blood vessels under the skin. They are not normally present at birth but Fig. 29.2 Strawberry haemangioma in an 11-month-old usually develop in the first few weeks of life and child grow rapidly. 60% occur on the head and neck.

Buckley number of moles and some resolve spontane- ously as the person gets old. The average Irish person has approximately 20–50 moles in adult- hood. Acquired nevi are usually small, pink, tan or brown coloured and may be flat or slightly raised. They all grow uniformly as the child gets bigger (Fig. 29.7). The development of a mela- noma from an acquired mole is extremely rare in a child under the age of 12. However, if an individual mole is changing in size, shape or colour or looks completely different from all the other moles (the ugly duckling sign), it should be monitored closely. The patient should be referred or the mole removed if there is a suspicion of a melanoma. Ephelids (freckles) are small 1–2 mm brown macules usually found on the exposed sites such as the face, arms and legs in children and can number from one or two up to hundreds. They usually appear after sun exposure and fade in the winter. They should be differentiated from juve- nile lentigines (2–10 mm) which appear early in childhood and solar lentigo (2–20 mm) that occur in the elderly from excessive UVL.

Linear epidermal nevus is due to an over- growth of the epidermis and usually present at birth or during early childhood. They present as brown macules or papules in a linear (straight line) fashion along the lines of embryonic devel- opment (lines of Blashko) (Fig. 29.10). They are usually found on the trunk or limbs and are nor- mally unilateral (Fig. 29.11). They often become more raised and warty as the child gets older. They are harmless and benign and usually do not require any treatment unless for cosmetic reasons. Naevus depigmentosus (also called achromic naevus) present as well-defined pale patch on the trunk or limbs in newborns or children.

Further con- fusion can arise if the patient has self-treated a rash with a myriad of creams from well meaning pharmacists, friends and family (Fig. 31.2). Fig. 31.2 Tinea Corporis. This patient also had tinea curis not responding to 1% hydrocortisone mixed with an These treatments can alter the classical appear- miconazole antifungal cream ance of the rash particularly, if applying a potent topical steroid. Potent topical steroids dampen down the inflammatory response to the fungus but usually promote its spread, resulting in a more widespread, unilateral, diffuse, non specific rash that cannot easily be identified as fungal in origin (Tinea incognito) (Fig. 31.3). This can often look like a patch of eczema or psoriasis prompting the doctor to use even more potent ste- roids. Any attempts at stopping the steroid will usually result in a rebound exacerbation of the rash which may become more scaly and pustular (Table 31.2).

Keeping the area dry is very important. 31.4 Tinea Manuum Tinea manuum usually causes a dry, slightly scaly rash on the skin creases of the palm of the hand. It is usually unilateral and can be associ- ated with athlete’s foot (“two feet, one hand syn- drome”) (Fig. 31.4). Skin scrapings from the Fig. 31.5 Tinea curis. This patient also had Tinea Paedis scaly palm creases usually clinch the diagnosis. 31.5 Tinea Cruris Tinea cruris causes an itchy, red, scaly rash in the groin creases but it can be very difficult to dif- ferentiate from intertrigo, eczema, seborrhoeic dermatitis or psoriasis of the groin (Figs. 31.5 and 31.6). Skin scrapings can help to identify if there is fungal infection present. Topical imidaz- ole antifungals are usually better than terbinafine as they have anti-yeast and antibacterial effects as Fig. 31.6 Tinea curis Fig. 31.4 Tinea manuum on the right hand 31 Fungal and Yeast Infection of Skin, Hair and Nails 247 31.6 Tinea Capitis Tinea capitis is more common in children under the age of 12. It is usually caused by infections from cats, dogs or cattle. It causes round patches of hair loss, but unlike alopecia areata, it also causes skin inflammation with redness and scali- ness of the skin, in the area of hair loss (Fig. 31.7). Skin scrapings or plucked hair from the affected areas may grow the fungus. Treatment is with oral terbinafine for 4–6 weeks (Table 31.3). Terbinafine should not be used in pregnancy. Griseofulvin is more effective for Microsporum Fig. 31.8 Kerion in the posterior scalp in a 16 year old canis (from cats, dogs or rabbits) (15–25 mg/kg/ farmer’s son.

The reported rate of clinical recurrence of onychomycosis ranges from 10% to 53%, regard- less of the treatment method used [2]. Laser and IPL treatment as well as photody- namic therapy have been shown recently to have some antifungal and anti-yeast effect by heating the subungal skin and killing the organisms.

These skin lesions typically become apparent approximately a 7–14 days (range, 3–30 days) after the tick has detached or was removed and should be at least 5 cm in largest diameter for a secure diagnosis. The erythematous rash spreads centrifugally and can extend to 10–20 cm with central clearing giv- ing a “bull’s eye” appearance. The rash usually occurs at the site of the bite, which is commonly on the leg, back, groin or axilla. It may be accom- panied by flu-like symptoms. Occasionally there can be more than one erythema migrans rash on the body. The rash will resolve spontaneously without treatment. Left untreated, Lyme disease may lead on to long term neurological, rheumato- logical or cardiac complications. An erythematous skin lesion present while an Ixodes tick is still attached or which has developed within 48 h of detachment is most likely a tick bite hypersensitivity reaction (i.e., a noninfectious pro- cess), rather than erythema migrans. Tick bite b hypersensitivity reactions are usually <5 cm in largest diameter, sometimes have an urticarial appearance, and typically begin to disappear within 24–48 h (Fig. 35.4b). In contrast, an early primary erythema migrans lesion usually increases in size over this time frame. To differentiate between the 2 processes, it may be useful to mark the borders of the skin lesion with ink and then observe for 1–2 days without antibiotic therapy [7].

The age of the patient may help when making a diagnosis. Younger patients are more likely to suffer from atopic eczema, congenital naevi and infectious rashes such as warts and impetigo. Adults are more likely to suffer from psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases such as lichen planus and occupational related skin dis- eases such as contact irritant dermatitis. The elderly are more likely to suffer from photodam- aged skin and degenerative diseases such as actinic keratosis, non-melanoma skin cancers, diabetic related skin diseases, and skin problems associated with varicose veins such as varicose eczema or ulcers. Because the elderly are often taking far more medications, drug related skin problems are more common in this age group. The distribution of a rash may help in the diagnosis.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis may be considered a more severe form of dandruff where there is red- ness and scaliness of the hair bearing areas of the scalp. It is caused by sensitivity to the commensal Pityrosporum ovale yeast in susceptible individu- als. There is normally evidence of seborrhoeic dermatitis on other parts of the body such as the eyebrows, nasolabial folds, beard area, over the sternum, between the shoulder blades, in the Fig. 36.1 Scalp psoriasis 288 D.

These fungi are more common in people of Afro Caribbean descent. Scalp ringworm usually presents with a local- ised patch of hair loss associated with an underly- ing inflammatory, scaly scalp rash. The diagnosis can be confirmed by taking skin scrapings or plucking hair for fungal stain and culture. Treatment is usually with an oral antifungal such as terbinafine or itraconazole for at least 4–6 weeks. If animal fungus is found on culture, the animal source should be identified and treated. Antifungal shampoos such as ketocon- azole may help prevent infection in other family members. A kerion is a thick boggy mass on the scalp as a result of an aggressive immunological reaction to scalp ringworm seen in some children (almost never in adults). Treatment is with a prolonged courses of oral anti-fungal medication and oral steroids may sometimes be require to dampen down the inflammatory reaction during the course of antifungal treatment. Oral antibiotics may be required if there is secondary bacterial infection. A kerion should never be incised and drained or surgically removed. Eczema of the scalp is common and often caused or aggravated by hair care products such as shampoos, conditioners, perms and colours. Patients usually present with a generalised tight, itchy, scaly scalp and there may be signs of eczema in other adjacent areas such as the ears, Fig. 36.2 Pityriasis amantacea in a 8 year old boy the hairline and the forehead.

Photosensitive rashes may also occur on the balding scalp (e.g. lupus and actinic dermatitis). 36.5 Scalp Lesions Pilar cysts (also known as a trichilemmal cysts) are common on the hairy or bald scalp and are similar to a sebaceous cysts but have no punctum and rarely become infected. They only need to be removed if they are uncomfortable or unsightly. Other benign lesions that can occur on the scalp include seborrhoeic keratosis and viral warts. Solar lentigo, actinic keratosis, non-melanoma skin cancer, lentigo maligna and melanoma may all occur in the scalp, especially if there is hair thinning or balding. Sebaceous naevi most commonly occur on the scalp. It is a non-melanocytic congenital skin ham- artoma consisting of a benign overgrowth of the epidermis, sebaceous glands, hair follicles, apo- crine glands and connective tissue.

It is extremely rare for sebaceous adenomas to transforms into a malignancy (a sebaceous carci- noma); however, a suspicious SA needs to be excised and biopsied. Patients with multiple seba- ceous adenoma may have the Muir-Torre Syndrome. This is a rare hereditary autosomal dominant cancer syndrome. People with this syn- drome are prone to developing cancers of the colon, breast and genitourinary tract. They may also develop other sebaceous tumours, such as sebaceous epithelioma or sebaceous carcinoma and other skin lesions such as keratoacanthoma. Sebaceous naevi which are usually found in the scalp are not usually related to Muir-Torre syndrome. Other rare lesions that can occur on the nose and cheeks include the typical red, scaly butterfly rash of systemic lupus erythematosus. Angiofibromas are a common feature of tuberous sclerosis and usually appear as small, pink or red papules across the cheeks and nose in a butterfly distribution. They usually appear between the ages of 3 and 10 years old and increase in size and number as the child gets older. Other cutaneous features of tuberous scle- rosis such as periungual fibromas, a shagreen patch in the lower lumbar area, multiple ash leaf macules and café au lait spots may help confirm the diagnosis. Epilepsy is present in about 70% of patients with tuberous sclerosis.

A potent 36.17 Hand Rashes and Lesions topical steroid may be required for the badly affected areas at night before going to bed but this will never work alone. Topical steroids should always be combined with good hand care, moisturising and avoidance of soaps and other irritants. Resistant cases of hand dermatitis may require a skin patch allergy test to rule out co-existing underlying contact allergic dermatitis to prod- ucts such as chromate (in cement and leather) or nickel (see Chap. 21). Underlying tinea pedis (athlete’s foot) can sometimes cause an allergic “id” reaction resulting in hand dermatitis. All patients with hand dermatitis should have their feet examined. If tinea pedis is found and treated it may help to clear the hand rash. Pompholyx is a severe form of blistering eczema of the palms and the palmar aspects of the fingers and can sometimes affect the feet. As the skin in these areas is thick, the blisters do not burst easily and may appear as itchy papules under the skin. Treatment is with potent or super potent topical steroids and good hand care as out- lined above. Severe cases of hand dermatitis may need to be referred to a consultant dermatologist for phototherapy or systemic treatment such as oral steroids, azathioprine, methotrexate, ciclo- sporin or oral retinoids such as alitretinoin (“Toctino®”). 304 D.

Actinic keratosis, Bowen’s disease and squamous cell carcinoma can all occur on the dorsum of the hands because of chronic sun exposure. BCCs are rare on the hands. Solar len- tigo and seborrhoeic keratosis can also occur on the dorsum of the hands. Melanoma (pig- mented or non-pigmented) may occur on the hands or around or under the nails. Ganglions usually present adjacent to joints on the fingers or Fig. 36.19 Secondary syphilis. Photo courtesy of Dr Myriam Raquel González-Oviedo the wrists (Fig. 36.20).

It can be associated with pain, numbness or tingling. It may be a pri- mary disease or rarely can it be linked with underlying auto-immune conditions such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. It is important to advise the patient to keep their hands warm by using ski gloves or hand warmers. Potent topical steroids may help painful chilblains. Peripheral vasodilators such as oral nifedipine may be required for more severe cases of Raynaud’s Fig. 36.21 Chilblains in a 19-year-old female especially in the winter.

Hyperhidrosis of the palms can be helped with aluminium chloride 20% (“Anhydrol Forte®” or “Driclor®”), iontophoresis or Botulinum toxin (“Botox®”) injections (see Chap. 12). Digital mucous cysts most commonly occur distal to the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint of the fingers. They can also occur on the toes. They can be considered a form of ganglion with a tract extending from the DIP joint to the cyst. There may be a groove on the adjacent nail from pres- sure on the nail plate (Fig. 36.23). They are harm- less and usually asymptomatic but patients sometimes want treatment for cosmetic or com- fort reasons. In a study of about 100 patients, surgery yielded the highest cure rate for digital mucous cysts (95%) compared with sclerotherapy (77%), cryotherapy (72%), corticosteroid injection (61%), and expression of cyst contents by repeated puncturing with a green needle under sterile conditions (39%) (P < 0.001) [1]. Acute and chronic paronychia are common and are discussed elsewhere (Chap. 41). Many of the rashes and lesions that occur on the feet are similar in their presentation and treat- ment to those that occur on the hands (e.g. con- tact allergic dermatitis, pompholyx, psoriasis, warts and ganglions). Other conditions such as fungal infections (tinea pedis) and corns are far more common on the feet while skin cancer (especially BCC) is less common on the feet. The feet are relatively photo-protected but squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma can occur on the Fig. 36.23 Digital myxoid cyst with nail groove and pos- sible tinea unguium soles or dorsum of the feet, on the toes and under 36 Regional Dermatology 307 the nails. Diabetes can lead to various foot prob- lems including a persistent tinea pedis, viral warts and foot ulcers. Tinea pedis is the most common scaly rash on the feet. It is uncommon before puberty and usu- ally presents as an itchy, moist, white, fissuring rash between the outer toe web spaces and the plantar aspects of the toe. Treatment involves using an imidazole anti-fungal cream and general foot care advice (Table 36.1). Resistant cases may require soaking of the feet in a 1% (1 in 100) solu- tion of potassium permanganate (see Chap. 31). If required, the diagnosis can be confirmed by send- ing skin scrapings for fungal stain and culture. Oral antifungal treatment may be indicated for more widespread tinea infection of the feet. Oral terbinafine is effective for a dermatophyte infec- tion and oral itraconazole is more effective if can- dida species are isolated. Eczema/dermatitis of the feet is less com- mon than on the hands. A contact allergy to leather or rubber or other chemicals in footwear can be confirmed by patch testing. Management is similar to that of hand eczema with the usual foot care advice. Fig. 36.24 Juvenile plantar dermatosis.

The patient may delay presenting to the doctor because of fear of infection or cancer. More severe disease can affect urinary and sexual function. You need to ask about the possibility of STDs and sexual preferences. Genital and peri- anal rashes and lesions in children may raise sus- picions of non-a ccidental injury or sexual abuse. 36.19.1 Female Genital Rashes, Fig. 36.25 Pitted keratolysis in a 21 year old male Ulcers and Lesions by proteases that are produced by the bacteria. The bad odour is due to sulphur compounds pro- duced by the bacteria. Treatment is with topical antibiotics such as fusidic acid cream and keep- ing the feet dry. Severe resistant cases may need oral erythromycin for 1 or 2 weeks. A thickened, scaly callus with fissuring is a com- mon problem on the heel of the feet. There is often no obvious underlying disease or inflammation but it can be sore and uncomfortable. The best manage- ment is by paring back the dead skin with a blade or a pumice stone. Heel balms such as “Flexitol Heel Balm®” (25% urea) applied twice a day for a few weeks may also help. Using it under occlusion at night with cling film may enhance the effect. More severe fissuring may need the assistance of a podia- trist for paring or the fitting of heel pads. Painful fissures can be sealed with tissue glue. Palmoplantar keratoderma causes severe thickening of the skin on the palms and soles. It can be inherited, acquired, and occasionally asso- ciated with an underlying internal malignancy (e.g. the Howell-Evans’ syndrome). Tylosis is inherited and can be associated with oesophageal carcinoma.

Unlike lichen sclerosus, it can also affect mucous membranes. When lichen planus affects the glans of the penis, it causes a reddish-purple, itchy, sore rash that may be erosive with vesicles, bullae and scars. It is sometimes necessary to take a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Lichen planus on geni- tal skin is usually treated with moderately potent or potent topical steroids for a few weeks until the condition comes under control and then main- tenance treatment with a mild or moderate potent topical steroid. More resistant cases may respond to tacrolimus. When lichen planus affects the genitalia, it can occasionally be pre-malignant. Cases that are resistant to treatment or develop ulcers or nodules should be biopsied to rule out malignant transformation. Lichen sclerosus is a rare rash that may affect the tip of the penis in uncircumcised men. It can also affect the perianal skin. Early cases may have little or no symptoms. More advanced dis- ease can cause itch, soreness and sometimes a tight band around the foreskin making an erec- tion and intercourse painful. The rash can some- times cause adhesions of the foreskin to the glans which may require surgical correction. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by skin biopsy.

They are a keratin-filled cyst that originates from the outer hair root sheath. Unlike a sebaceous cysts (epidermoid cysts), pilar cysts do not have a punctum. They are most commonly found in the scalp and the scrotum. They are usually small and painless but may be multiple (Fig. 36.29). Although they are harm- less, patients often want them removed for cos- metic reasons. Angiokeratomas are benign vascular malfor- mation of capillaries that can occur on the scro- tum or vulva.

Genital herpes can cause a recurrent, painful, vesicular eruption in the genital area (see Chap. 32). Rare causes of ulcers on the genitalia include drug eruption, Behcet’s disease (see above under female genital ulceration) and dermatitis artefacta. 36.21 Perianal Itch, Rashes and Lesions Fig. 36.29 Scrotal cysts in a 21 year old Non-melanoma skin cancer of the penis or scrotum is rare but penile intraepithelial neoplasia, Bowen’s disease and SCC can occur on the shaft, glans or scrotum. Melanoma can also occur on the glans penis, the shaft of the penis or the scrotum. Skin cancer on the penis usually has a poor prognosis partially because embarrassment may delay presentation. Any suspicious growth, ulcer or rash on the penis or scrotum that fails to respond to treatment should be biopsied to rule out malignancy. Most confirmed cases are treated surgically by a urologist. Scabies in men almost always cause itchy nodules on the shaft of the penis and this sign can be used to help confirm the diagnosis of scabies. 36 Regional Dermatology 317 Itch and soreness around the perianal area is a oral anti-helmintic such as mebendazole, 100 mg very common presentation in general practice. stat, which is repeated once more, 2–4 weeks There can be many causes but most patients can later.

The thin skin in the perianal area combined with the occlusive effects of the folds of skin in this area makes it very vulnerable to steroid damage such as erythema, skin thinning and skin infection.

Cellulitis and erysipelas are common in the lower leg and can often start with a small scratch or scrape in the skin of the foot or lower leg. Some cases arise from broken skin due to tinea pedis. The red, hot, tender rash spreads up the leg and in more extensive cases the patient may have flu-like symptoms. Treatment is either with oral or intravenous antibiotics, rest and elevation. Cellulitis can sometime be confused with a red, swollen leg that can occur as a result of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If there are any doubts, a Doppler study should be carried out urgently as DVT can be potentially life threaten- ing if it progresses to a pulmonary embolism. Schamberg’s disease (also known as “pro- gressive pigmentary dermatitis of Schamberg”) is a chronic discoloration of the skin found in the lower legs. It causes rusty, brown/orange, patchy, non-blanching purpura that begins around the ankles and progresses up the lower leg over a period of months or years. ‘Cayenne pepper’ type spots develop at the edge of old lesions (Fig. 36.32a, b). There are usually no symptoms and there are no obvious causes or effective treatments. Cosmetic camouflage may help to disguise the rash. Purpura is due to leakage of blood vessels which causes deposition of hemosiderin into the Fig. 36.31 Erythema ab igne from hot water bottles in a 17 year old skin.

This creates Trauma to the leg can cause an ulcer but most a reversal of flow with venous blood passing traumatic ulcers will heal in a few weeks with backwards from the deep to the superficial venous systems through incompetent perforators, causing venous hypertension which can lead to varicose eczema and/or varicose ulcers (see Fig. 37.4). 37.5 Treatment Compression is the most important strategy when treating varicose ulcers since this will deal with the underlying cause (i.e. venous hypertension). However, compression bandag- ing or hosiery might further compromise blood supply if there is any arterial insufficiency. Fig. 37.3 Ulcers in both lower legs failing to heal after a few years.

Unlike BCCs and Bowen’s disease, SCCs have the potential to spread and metastasize to local lymph nodes or beyond and can be life threatening. Patients who are immunosupressed (e.g. renal transplant patients) are more likely to develop multiple, aggressive SCCs and in fact skin cancer is the leading cause of death in solid organ transplant patients.

However, a more pragmatic approach is to state that any BCC that cannot be marked with an adequate border and completely excised both laterally and deeply is to be considered high risk for that surgeon and should be referred. Low risk BCCs are probably best excised with 4 mm border all round.

Most methods for treating BCCs have a greater than 90% cure rate. Mohs micrographic surgery is the gold standard when treating BCCs and has a cure rate of 97–99% in experienced hands (Table 45.15). However, because this treat- ment method is time consuming, labour intensive and expensive, it should be carried out only on high risk tumours (Table 45.12). Mohs micrographic surgery involves excising the tumour, marking the edges and immediately checking the borders using frozen sections while the patient is still in the operating theatre to ensure the entire tumour has been removed.

Any adult or child of African descent with an unusual scaly rash on the body or scalp should have skin scrapings and/or plucked hairs sent for fungal stain and culture to rule out an underlying fungal infection. Although animal sources such as tinea canis (from cats or dogs) or tinea verru- cosus (from cattle) are the most common causes of ringworm in Ireland, unusual organisms such as Trichophyton tonsurans (person-to-person spread) and Trichophyton violaceum are often found in Africans. Tinea capitis is most commonly found in chil- dren. Treatment is usually with oral antifungals such as griseofulvin, terbinafine, itraconazole or fluconazole for 4 to 6 weeks (see Chap. 31). Ketoconazole shampoo may help reduce spread of Trichophyton tonsurans and may help clear asymptomatic carriers within a household.

If burns (African type skin) patients with vitiligo get sun on their skin it usu- ally only makes the vitiligo more obvious as the non-affected areas will tan and the vitiligo areas will remain white, thus making the condition more conspicuous. Lupus Erythematosus (DLE, sub-acute lupus and SLE) is a rare condition that causes multiple red, scaly plaques that can occur on any part of the body but it is usually worse on the exposed areas of the body (scalp, face, ears, neck and hands) as the rash is aggravated by UVL (Fig. 49.2). Although each type of lupus has its own skin manifestions, they all are photosensi- tive conditions. The plaques of lupus can leave permanent scars if not treated aggressively with very potent topical steroids. Patients with lupus have to be sun smart both to control the condition and prevent relapse. Porphyria Cutaneous Tarda (PCT) is a rare condition that usually presents as a photo- sensitive rash on the dorsum of the hands, the forearms or the face. It is caused by increased levels of porphyrins in the skin. The patient usu- ally has fragile skin in these exposed areas that can tear easily with minor trauma. They may also develop blisters and scars. This condition is caused by a defective enzyme in the liver known Fig. 49.1 Telangectasia in a 48 year old as uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.

Melasma (chloasma) can cause facial hyper- pigmentation in women and usually occurs dur- ing and after pregnancy, or when a woman is using hormonal contraception.

In addition, sun protection should be used while the skin is inflamed to reduce further hyperpigmentation. 49.7 Polymorphic Light Eruption Polymorphic light eruption is a common condi- tion that can affect up to 10% of the population. It is most common in adult women between the ages of 20 and 40. The usual history is that the patient develops an itchy, eczematous, urticarial, Fig. 49.3 Photodermatitis, possibly drug-related polymorphic (= many forms) rash, sometimes known as “prickly heat”, that begins at the start With photoallergic reactions, the ultraviolet of the summer, the start of a summer holiday or at exposure changes the structure of the drug (sys- the beginning of a course of sunbed sessions.

This can cause blisters and brown streaks that are often linear where the plant has rubbed against the skin. It can appear 2-3 days after exposure and it is recognized by the bizarre shape of the lesions and their presence in sun exposed areas. Strimmer dermatitis is a similar condition where the sap from the plants is spread onto the skin of the person using the strimmer to cut grass and weeds.

Patients with trexate and systemic steroids in severe, extensive systemic sclerosis may also develop Sjögren’s syndrome (dry eye, mouth and vagina). Severe cases can be associated with a vasculitis that can affect internal organs including kidneys, lungs and skin. In more advanced cases the skin gener- ally becomes tight (scleroderma is the Greek word for “hard skin”) and can affect the face, resulting in expressionless facial features and dif- ficulty opening the mouth.

It can be resistant to treatment and it can cause considerable disfiguration. Diagnosis is usually by skin biopsy and tissue culture may have to be performed to rule out an infectious cause such as mycobacteria or deep fungal infection. A chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests should be performed to rule out pulmonary or mediastinal sarcoid. Routine investigation should include serum calcium, liver function tests, Vitamin D levels, thyroid function tests, VDRL, ANF and TB screening including a tuberculin skin test. Blood tests for TB including Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) such as QuantiFERON Gold which is a marker for active TB that is not influenced by previous BCG vaccination.

Injection site reactions from insulin can also lead to local skin reactions. 52.5 Skin Lesions with an Association with Diabetes 52.5.1 Necrobiosis Lipoidica Necrobiosis lipoidica is a rare granulomatous Fig. 52.1 Necrobiosis lipoidica that was present for 5 skin disorder that most commonly occurs on the years without being diagnosed with diabetes 52 Skin Problems Associated with Diabetes 491 Occasionally, granuloma annulare can become more generalised in adults, particularly spreading to the skin folds around the axillae and groin. The main problem with granuloma annulare is cosmetic as it can cause an unsightly rash. Some cases can be associated with itch. Diagnosis can be confirmed by a biopsy which show necrobiotic degeneration of dermal collagen but despite the name there is no granulomas on histology. Milder cases with little or no symptoms do not necessar- ily require treatment as the plaques often clear spontaneously after a few months or years. More troublesome cases may respond to potent topical steroids or intralesional steroid injections. Some cases can respond to cryosurgery, topical imiqui- mod or topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus). Widespread cases may require systemic doxycy- cline [5], steroids or other immunosuppressants.

It is self explanatory and can be simply handed to the patient who is asked to fill it in without the need for detailed explanation. It is usually completed in one or two minutes. SCORING The scoring of each question is as follows: Very much scored 3 A lot scored 2 A little scored 1 Not at all scored 0 Not relevant scored 0 Question 7, ‘prevented work or studying’ scored 3 The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.

They often have deep psychological bling insects crawling on or under the skin. 53 Skin and the Mind (Psychodermatology) 501 It is very hard to reason with these patients because of their lack of insight. They will often have seen a number of different doctors who have treated them with various anti-scabies and other anti-infective agents, which will further reinforce their delusion, despite the lack of response to these treatments. Some of these patients may have deep underlying psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, dementia, or schizo- phrenia. However, many are quite well apart from their isolated mono delusion of infestation. It is very important to encourage the patients Fig. 53.2 Dermatitis artefacta. Photo courtesy of Dr to stop using insecticides or any other anti- Myriam Raquel González Oviedo infective agents. They should be encouraged to stop picking and scratching. They need to avoid soaps and other irritants and moisturise their skin gently to try and ease any itch. Patients with delusional infestation will often have to be referred to a colleague with more expe- rience in skin disorders as it can be difficult to prove definitively that the patient is not being bit- ten or infested. Other causes of generalised pruri- tus need to be excluded. It is important to empathise with the patient and their family and to get them to consider psychological causes for their symptoms. The emphasis when treating the patient is to focus on relief of the symptoms rather than be fixated on the cause. However, many of these patients will require treatment with anti-psychotics such as pimozide (“Orap®”). The initial doses of 1–2 mg daily should be titrated slowly (1 mg every 5–7 Fig. 53.3 Trichotillomania. Photo courtesy of Dr days) to the effective dose that is best tolerated.

Buckley Table 57.3 PCSA Guidelines on anticoagulants and cutaneous surgery in the community Risks to patient from stopping anticoagulation or antiplatelet drugs include stroke, DVT/PE, MI, or even death. The risk of skin surgery bleeding may be inconvenient, can result in a haematoma or an abscess and may jeopardise a flap or graft but is rarely serious or life threatening Stopping anticoagulants that have been prescribed for strong clinical indications is therefore rarely justifiable Meticulous operative technique is always required to minimise the risk of bleeding with cutaneous surgery but, even so, bleeding problems can occur. Excessive bleeding during surgery usually responds to electrosurgery or vessel tying, followed by a pressure dressing and patient rest and elevation of the operative site where possible. However, some agents can cause prolonged oozing after the local anaesthetic (LA) wears off, or for several days post-op, even if excellent haemostasis is achieved intra-operatively. For this reason, reducing this risk by postponing surgery, altering the choice of procedure or repair, or sometimes withholding medications may be prudent. The use of LA without adrenaline may be considered so as to avoid delayed bleeding problems General tips to reduce risk of bleeding • Consider postponing surgery until risk factor(s) can be removed or optimised • Choose safer procedure type if possible or alternative if sufficiently effective e.g. radiotherapy, cryosurgery or non-surgical options such as Aldara or Efudix. • Use meticulous surgical techniques and consider electrical surgery, radiosurgery, aluminium chloride or tranexamic acid for injection (“Cyklokapron®” applied topically on a gauze to control bleeding). • For open wounds consider an alginate dressing to adsorb exudates which may aid haemostasis • Elevate and compress post-op • Consider referral to a more experienced operator • Consider admitting the patient overnight post-surgery Risk factors for significant post-operative bleeding events • Previous post-op bleeding episode • Unable or unwilling to rest post-op • Bleeding tendency (anticoagulants, Haemophilia, low platelets <50 × 109/l, herbal medicines) • Age >65 Risk Stratification of Community Surgery Procedures Low Risk Procedures – Curettage – Punch biopsy – Incisional biopsy – scar length <10 cm – Excision and direct closure on trunk, limbs or compressible head and neck sites (scar length <10cm) – Joint injection – Cryosurgery Moderate Risk Procedures – Excision and direct closure on non-compressible areas (neck, lip, genitals) – Wide excision and direct closure on trunk and limbs – Secondary intention wounds on compressible sites – Grafts on compressible sites (and split thickness graft donor sites) – Small local flaps(e.g. rhombic on nose, or wedge or helical rim advancement on ear) – Ingrown toenails High Risk Procedures – Secondary intention wounds on non-compressible sites – Excision within the orbit (e.g. eyelids) – Where bone is involved – Local flaps on head and neck with wide undermining (e.g. forehead, periocular – especially orbital, cheek, large nose flaps, neck) – Local interpolated flaps (e.g. paramedian forehead flap) – Wide excision and direct closure on non-c ompressible sites (e.g. neck) – Grafts on non-compressible sites – Vasectomy Some high bleeding risk procedures could potentially be avoided altogether by choosing alternative methods of treatment such as topical therapies (e.g. Aldara, Efudix etc.), cryosurgery or deep X-ray therapy (DXT) in patients who are at increased risk of bleeding 57 Simple Skin Surgery 527 Table 57.3 (continued) It is recommended that most anti-thrombotic agents are continued for most skin surgery procedures This is based on the evidence of a very low risk of morbidity and mortality from peri-operative bleeding, versus a variable risk of highly morbid or fatal thrombotic events associated with cessation of anticoagulants Specific points about bleeding agents or tendencies: Aspirin Aspirin (ASA) is often taken by patients without clear indication (e.g. post-MI, post-CVA or post-stenting or CABG) in which case it can be stopped 10–14 days before surgery. Otherwise unlikely to cause significant bleeding problems in isolation at 75–300 mg od. If considering medium or high risk skin surgery stop 10–14 days pre-op for full reversal, 5 days for 50% efficacy. Restart 7 days post-op. Clopidogrel (“Plavix®”) and prasugrel (“Efient®”) These are antiplatelet drugs that can cause prolonged oozing. For clopidogrel, postpone surgery until off drug if possible e.g. sometimes used for 1 year post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). If high bleeding risk procedure ask the prescriber’s advice regarding the risk of stopping clopidogrel for 7 days pre-op and if a substitute alternative drug should be used while off the drug. Restart 7 days post-op. Similar rules for prasugrel (“Efient®”)— stop 7 days pre op (stop 9 days if you want complete reversal) Warfarin Stopping or avoiding not usually justified. Check INR 72 hours pre-op. The bleeding risk is very small if the INR is <3.5 for low risk procedures. For medium or high risk procedures aim for an INR of 2–2.5 if the therapeutic range allows for the indication the patient is taking warfarin. Take advice from the patients GP or haematology if INR reduction needed NSAIDs: Stop 3 days pre-op and for 7 days post-op if possible for moderate and high risk procedures Dipyridamole (“Persantin®”) No need to stop for cutaneous surgery if used alone. If taken with other anticoagulants stop 48 hours before medium or high risk surgery. Restart 7 days post op. Novel oral anticoagulants / Direct acting oral anticoagulants (NOACs/DOACS): E.g.: apixaban (“Eliquis®” 2.5–5 mg BD), dabigatran (“Pradaxa®” 15 mg BD), edoxaban (“Lixiana®” 60 mg OD), rivaroxaban ( “Xarelto®” 15–20 mg OD) For low risk cutaneous surgery procedures: Perform the procedure just before the next dose is due Or Perform the procedure approximately 18–24 hours after the last dose. The drug can be restarted 6 hours post surgery. This means one dose of a drug taken BD (e.g. “Eliquis®” or “Pradaxa®”) may be missed on the evening before the surgery and take the morning dose six hours post-surgery on the day of the surgery. Take the evening dose as late as possible. For once a day drugs (“Lixiana®” or “Xarelto®”) take the daily dose six hours post surgery on the day of the surgery. Schedule the surgery for early in the morning For moderate risk cutaneous surgery procedures: Check with the prescriber (e.g. cardiologist) and consider stopping the drug 24 hours before the procedure (If the creatinine clearance (CrCl) is between 15 and 30 ml/min apixaban (“Eliquis®”) or edoxaban (“Lixiana®”) or rivaroxaban (“Xarelto®”) should be stopped 36 hours before the procedure) If the creatinine clearance (CrCl) is between 50 and 80 ml/min dabigatran (“Pradaxa®”) should be stopped 48 hours before the procedure and if it is between 30 and 50 ml/min it should be stopped 72 hours before the procedure) For high risk cutaneous surgery procedures: Check with the prescriber (e.g. cardiologist) and consider stopping the drug 48 hours before the procedure (If the creatinine clearance (CrCl) is between 50 and 80 ml/min dabigatran (“Pradaxa”) should be stopped 72 hours before the procedure and if it is between 30 and 50 ml/min it should be stopped 96 hours before the procedure) Antidotes A specific reversal agent for dabigatran (“Pradaxa”) is available: idarucizumab (“Praxbind®”). This is licensed for use in adults treated with dabigatran etexilate when rapid reversal of its anticoagulant effects is required for emergency surgery or urgent procedures, or in life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding (see the data sheet—SPC) There are currently no other licensed agents to reverse the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran etexilate or any other NOAC To reverse warfarin in an emergency situation consider fresh frozen plasma (FFP), Vitamin K, recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) and/or Three Factor PCC which can all be given iv usually in the A+E department Combinations of multiple drugs Shown to increase the risk of bleeding significantly so consider taking advice on modification of regimen if high bleeding risk procedure.

Buckley Table 57.3 (continued) Herbal remedies and supplements Examples include (but are not restricted to): Garlic, Ginger, Ginkgo, Ginseng, Saw Palmetto, Fish Oil (e.g. cod liver), Camomile, Feverfew. Many can promote bleeding (and other relevant effects). Only likely to be significant for patients on other antithrombotic agents, or those at high risk from post-operative bleeding.

Buckley When taking a punch biopsy the skin should be stretched perpendicular to the lines of skin tension so when the biopsy is taken and the ten- sion released the round hole will end up in the shape of an ellipse running in the lines of skin tension, which is easier to close (see Fig. 57.6). Marking the area to be operated and its borders with a skin marker before putting in the local anaesthetic is very helpful as the anaesthetic may blanch the skin and make the lesion more diffi- cult to identify (Fig. 57.2). Most skin surgery errors are made with the pen, not the knife. Carefully patient and lesion selection plus mark- ing the lesion and borders with ink before surgery is very important. The punch biopsy needle needs to be rotated while exerting very light downward vertical pressure which will ensure the round blades will cut cleanly into the skin and the needle should be advanced so that the specimen includes a good cuff of subcutaneous fat. On thin skin such as the face or over a tendon, the needle might only have to be advanced 50% down the hilt, Fig. 57.3 Three danger zones for motor nerve damage in which will allow an adequate biopsy without cutaneous surgery.

(Table 58.1) Table 58.1 Rules for safer more effective cryosurgery 1. Never treat any lesion unless you can make a confident, named, clinical diagnosis on visual assessment. If there is any doubt as to the diagnosis, take a biopsy or refer the patient on to a colleague for a second opinion 2. Cryosurgery is unsuitable for most children under the age of 6. One exception is molluscum contagiousum. These can be treated with a 2–3 seconds freeze which is practically painless. Some children between the ages of 6 and 12 may be unable to tolerate cryosurgery 3. The treatment of choice for warts or verrucae in children is either to do nothing or use topical treatments. Cryosurgery should be used only in children with difficult or complicated warts or verrucae and only if they can tolerate a local anaesthetic 4. Always lie the patients down when performing cryosurgery, as fainting could occur. 5. Always pare down horny or keratotic lesions before cryosurgery, as keratin is a very good thermal insulator and will prevent from getting a sufficient depth of freeze 6. Bulky tumours such as large warts and verrucae should be debulked by paring, curetting or doing a deep shave biopsy under local anaesthetic before cryosurgery 7. When treating large lesions such as large warts and verrucae >5 mm it is advisable to infiltrate with local anaesthetic using a 30G needle under the lesion before paring and freezing. However, avoid a local anaesthetic with adrenaline on or near the fingers, toes, the tops of the nose and earlobe, as it can cause vaso-constriction 8. Always warn patients about post-operative swelling, pain and possible serous or haemorrhagic blistering. Instruct them to burst the blister with a sterile pin and squeeze out the fluid. They should bathe the area in some dilute “Dettol” and apply an antiseptic cream such as “Savlon” cream and dress with a dry dressing 9. Oral analgesics such as paracetamol or ibuprofen may be given before or immediately after cryosurgery and continued as required 10. Treat just one hand per session when treating bilateral hand warts. If there are numerous hand warts, treat only half of one hand or less per session as postoperative pain and swelling can be troublesome. As a general rule, treat a maximum of 4–8 warts per session 11. When treating verrucae treat one foot per session. In addition, treat only the fore foot or the hind foot (not both) per treatment session, as this will allow the patient to walk on either the heel or the toe post-operatively. Spraying down a suitably sized auroscope cone can improve the success rate and reduce the complications when treating verrucae. Avoid using the auroscope cones on the face or hands, as scarring may be a problem 12. Any cryosurgery probes or tips that touch the patients skin should be sterilised between patients. If you are using the cotton bud or dip probe technique, decant a small amount of liquid nitrogen into a polystyrene cup and dip into this. Discard the cotton bud, the liquid nitrogen and the polystyrene cup after treating each patient, as viruses can survive in liquid nitrogen 13. If you are a beginner in cryosurgery, confine your treatments to warts and verrucae for the first year until you get used to handling the equipment, the patient and the tissues. It is advisable to get training and supervision from an experienced cryosurgeon before treating patients alone in your surgery 538 D.

As you freeze from the surface down, the isotherms get progressively warmer until equilibrium is reached between the cold of the cryogen at the surface and the heat of the skin from the underlying circulation (Figs. 59.10 and 59.11). Hypertrophic warts are often covered with thick keratin, which acts as a ther- mal insulator. This has to be removed with a blade to allow the freeze to penetrate to the base of the wart. Even after removing keratin, many Fig. 59.6 “Hydrozid®” (norflurane) can reach −60 °C.

Stronger steroids will usually induce a rapid remission which can then be maintained with the less potent varieties (the step down approach). Alternatively, reducing the potent topical steroid to twice a week on the areas that tend to flare up during exacerbations (e.g. the backs of the knee and front of the elbows) may help maintain the improvement long term.

Some of the newer potent topical steroids such as mometasone furoate (“Elocon®”) may be safer for chronic use. TS should always be reduced or stopped gradually if they have been used for more than a few weeks, as suddenly stopping them may result in a rebound flare of the underlying conditions (e.g. psoriasis). Sometimes combining topical steroids with other topical agents such as an antibiotic (“Fucidin H®” or “Fucibet®”), urea (“Calmurid HC®”), tar (“Alphosyl HC®”), antifungals (“Daktacort®” or “Canesten HC®”) or salicylic acid (“Diprosalic®”) may have a steroid sparing effect. As a general rule, nothing stronger than 1% hydrocortisone should be used on the face or in flexures. One exception is in DLE (lupus) on the face where potent or very potent steroids may sometimes be required. A potent topical steroid (e.g. “Elocon® “) is sometimes necessary for severe dermatosis on the face in adults but it should be stopped after five days, as prolonged use may results in side effects such as skin thin- ning, telangectasia (broken veins), steroid rosacea (Fig. 63.3) or perioral dermatitis.

Unfortunately a small number of people can get quite troublesome acne which can have a major impact on their life. Many of these people become extremely self-con- scious, shy and withdrawn. Fortunately all forms of acne, even the most severe, can now be cleared up with safe effective treatments. Acne is most common in teenagers and usually clears up within a few years. In a small number of people their acne can persist into their 20s, 30s or even into their 40s. In addition, some people do not start to develop acne until they are well into their 20s (“adult onset acne”). Comments such as “don’t worry, you’ll grow out of it” are unhelpful. While it is true that acne will eventually settle down this may take months or years during which time the person may suffering from permanent physical or psychological scars. There are many misconceptions about acne. Many young people and their parents believe it is due to a food allergy or lack of hygiene. This is totally untrue. Acne is primarily a hormonal disorder. In the teens and early 20s there is a surge of hormones associated with puberty. In people with acne their skin is hypersensitive to these normal fluctuations in hormonal levels. This causes their skin to over- produce oil, which becomes blocked in the pores. Once the pores are blocked the oil becomes trapped and swells up to cause black heads and white heads (comedomes). These eventually become infected with bacteria to form pimples and spots. Squeezing, scratching or picking spots usually causes them to last twice as long, so try to leave them alone. Picking may also cause the spots to spread and may scar the skin. Acne will eventually clear up but scars won’t! Other factors that aggravate acne are stress, as experienced before exams. Moisturisers and oily cosmetics should be avoided in the acne- affected areas since the skin is already too oily. A lightweight non-greasy make-up (e.g. a “non- comedogenic” make-up) will do no harm and will help cover up the spots for special occasions. Green concealers are best for the red spots. Once the green is applied, cover with skin colour oil free make up for best results. Many women with acne get worse prior to a period. Certain forms of contracep- D. Buckley (*) The Ashe Street Clinic, Tralee, Co. Kerry, Ireland © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021 585 D. Buckley, P. Pasquali (eds.), Textbook of Primary Care Dermatology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29101-3_66 586 D. Buckley tives such as progesterone only pills, implants or coils may aggravate acne. Junk food may also make acne worse. Taking too much dairy produce may aggravate acne but there is no need to give it up completely. A glass of milk a day is good for your bones. Avoid foods rich in sugar or fats. If you eat chicken or pork, try to ensure it is free range. Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, lean meat and fish. Treatment of acne will depend on its severity. Most mild cases can be managed by the person themselves with simple products that can be bought from the chemist. Washing the face twice a day with soap and water is helpful since this will remove some of the excess oil. However, excessive wash- ing will not clear acne. Various acne lotions, creams or gels, which are recommended by your chemist or doctor, should be applied all over the acne-affected areas and not just onto individual spots. They will help clear up existing spots and will prevent new ones developing. They all help reduce the oili- ness of the skin and help clear blackheads and whiteheads. These products often cause some transient drying of the skin for a few hours after application. It may take 6–12 weeks before one starts to see an improvement with these acne creams so patience and perseverance is crucial in order to see results. More resistant or severe cases of acne may need more potent topical cream or gel or tablet treat- ments, which can only be prescribed by your doctor. The most common tablet treatment is Tetracyclin tablets, which have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. These are extremely safe and effective. In women a hormonal tablet treatment is sometimes used. Tablet treatments are usually combined with topical treatments for 6 months until the acne is fully under control. The improvement is then maintained with topical agents alone to prevent your acne from returning. The topical agents can be continued for months or years until you are sure you have “grown out of your acne”. People with a lot of red spots confined to their face with not too many blackheads or whiteheads might benefit from a course of pulse dye laser treatment (Regenlite). This has an anti-i nflammatory effect similar to standard acne tablets and can give similar results. The laser light is passed over the skin, which can cause minor discomfort only. Most people need one laser treatment per month for 3 months. Very occasionally acne can be extremely severe and aggressive with extensive pimples, spots and even lumps on the face, back or chest, which can leave permanent scars (nodular, cystic or scarring acne). This rare severe type of acne may not respond to the standard treatments. These people usually need “Roaccutane®” tablets, which are a very potent vitamin A treatment, which will clear even the most severe resistant cases. However, this vitamin A tablet treatment has some uncomfortable but reversible side effects and so is reserved for only the most severe, resistant cases. People taking Roaccutane® need monthly blood tests and females should not become pregnant when on this drug. Acne is not the only condition that causes spots and pimples on the face. If your skin is not clearing up with simple acne treatments, check with your doctor as you may be suffering from something other than acne. In summary, acne is a common condition which unfortunately occurs in a very vulnerable age- group and can cause physical and psychological scarring. Nowadays all types of acne, no matter how severe or extensive, can be managed successfully with safe effective treatments. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 587 66.1.2 Isotretinoin (“Roaccutance®”): What patients need to know Oral isotretinoin is an extremely effective medication for the treatment of severe or resistant acne. It is derived from vitamin A. Doctors have gained a lot of experience with this drug, which was first launched in 1982. Most patients need between 4 and 9 months of treatment depending on the sever- ity and extent of their acne and the daily dose. Almost all patients respond to oral isotretinoin, even those with severe, resistant acne. Most patients, who clear with acne, will remain clear for a long period of time and many will be permanently cured of their acne. However, about one in three patients may relapse a few months or a few years after completing a course of oral isotretinoin. These patients may respond to less potent forms of acne treatments or may require another course of oral isotretinoin. For female patients, it is imperative that they do not become pregnant while taking oral isotreti- noin as this can have severe damaging effects on an unborn child. For this reason, all women of childbearing age, whether they are sexually active or not, have to use an effective method of contra- ception (e.g. “the pill”) for 1 month before, throughout the course of treatment and for 1 month after completing the course of oral isotretinoin. For women who are sexually active, they need to use two effective methods of contraception (e.g. the oral contraceptive pill and condoms) for the same period of time. The pill can sometimes make you moody—if this happens please let your doctor know. If a woman becomes pregnant or thinks she might be pregnant while taking oral isotretinoin she should stop the drug immediately and report her concerns to her doctor. Although oral isotretinoin has been available since 1982, there is still no clear-cut evidence that it can cause depression. However, if you have persistent tiredness, irritability, poor concentration, sleep disruption, sadness, crying spells, loss of motivation or forgetfulness while on oral isotretinoin and if these persists most days for more than 2 weeks, please let your doctor or the nurse know. You may require reduction in the dose of your treatment or you may have to stop your medication while these symptoms are being assessed. Some studies have shown that acne itself can cause mood disorders or depression and treatment with oral isotretinoin can improve mood in these people. Please let your doctor know if you ever suffered from depression in the past. Please inform your family doctor that you are taking a course of oral isotretinoin. If you are attend- ing a counsellor or a psychiatrist, please inform your doctor before staring this medication and please inform your counsellor that you are taking oral isotretinoin. Please read all the printed information supplied by your doctor and the product information contained in your box of medication. Oral isotretinoin does not mix well with alcohol or illegal drugs. Please try to abstain from these while on this medication and for 1 month after completing your course. You will need to be seen monthly for fasting blood tests and a urine test for the duration of the course of your treatment and one final visit 3 months after completing your treatment. Female patients need one extra visit 5 weeks after finishing oral isotretinoin. Please discuss any problems you may be experiencing with your doctor or the nurse on each of these visits. Other possible Side Effects: Oral isotretinoin will cause dryness of the mucous membranes, (lips, nose, eyes, genitalia and the skin around the anus). These symptoms are often dose related and so if you are having a lot of trouble with dryness, your doctor may reduce the dose you are taking. 588 D. Buckley Moisturiser your lips frequently with a greasy lip moisturiser such as “Vaseline Lips®”, “La Roche-Pasay Cicaplast Lip Balm®” or “Carmex Lip Balm®”. You may also have to moisturise your nose, genitalia and peri anal skin. If you suffer dry eyes your doctor may recommend artificial tears. Please inform your doctor or nurse if you are still having trouble despite moisturising. Your doctor may prescribe 1% Hydrocotisyl ointment, which can be applied to the lips twice a day throughout the treatment, if dry lips are a problem and not responding to a lip moisturiser. This can also be applied to the genitalia and the peri anal skin, twice a day, if dryness is not resolved by simple moisturisers such as “Vaseline®” or “Emulsifying ointment”. Sometimes the skin in these areas can get cracked, sore and scabby. If this occurs, you may require topical or oral antibiotics. Please discuss with your doctor. If you have suffered from eczema in the past, you may experience a relapse of your eczema while on oral isotretinoin. This usually responds to greasy moisturisers, avoiding soaps and other irritants and eczema treatments such as steroid ointments. Some people may have to lower the dose of oral isotretinoin they are on. Some people will get a temporary flare up of their acne in the first month of treatment. Oral isotretinoin can make your skin more sensitive in the sun, so be careful in the sunny weather by wear- ing appropriate clothing, a broad brimmed hat and high factor sun blocks (SPF 30). As your skin is sensitive while on oral isotretinoin, do not have any cosmetic skin treatments (waxing, dermabra- sion, laser) while on this treatment and for 6 months after completing the course. Some people may experience lower back pain, muscle aches or joint pains while on oral isotreti- noin, particularly if they are training hard. You may have to reduce your level of physical activity or your doctor might reduce the daily dose. If this does not help, please discuss your problems with your doctor. Other rare side effects include temporary hair thinning, headaches, tiredness, diarrhoea and difficulty with night vision or colour vision. If you have any of these problems, please discuss them with your doctor or the nurse. Oral isotretinoin cannot be used if a woman is breastfeeding. Do not donate blood at the blood bank while on this medication and for 1 month after finishing. Do not share your tablets with anyone else, particularly other women. Do not take vitamin A supplements while on oral isotretinoin. Please do not use other acne therapies while on oral isotretinoin. Dosage The usual starting dose is 0.5 mg per kilogram of your body weight per day. Oral isotretinoin should be taken once or twice a day with food or with a glass of milk as this helps its absorption. It is easier to remember to take your tablets if you take them at the same time every day. If you are under 18 years old, you will need to be accompanied by an adult for every visit. Please do not Google the word “Roaccutane®” or “oral isotretinoin” as you will get a lot of false information regarding this medication which may confuse you. Do not buy oral isotretinoin on the internet—it needs to be prescribed by a doctor with experience in its use and it needs to be dispensed by your local pharmacist. For more information also see: www.aad.org/isotretinoin If you have any problems while on oral isotretinoin please contact your doctor or nurse immediately. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 589 66.2 Consent Forms 66.2.1 CONSENT FORM NAME OF PATIENT: __________________________________________________________ DATE OF BIRTH: _____________________________________________________________ ADDRESS: _____________________________________________________________________ I hereby consent to undergo the operation/treatment of: ______________________________________________________________________________ The procedure, alternatives and risks have been explained to me in clear terms by Dr. ............................

Its importance lies in its richness in two things: protein and calcium (vital for normal growth of bones and teeth). In order for children to obtain adequate amounts of these nutrients on an egg and milk-free diet, usually they must be given a milk substitute. These can be subdivided into four catego- ries: (1) soya “milk”, (2) casein hydrolysate formula, (3) goat’s milk, and (4) calcium tablets. It is worth considering each of them in turn. Soya “Milk” Soya “milk” is based on protein from soya beans and contains no cow’s milk protein. Therefore, it is often suggested for a milk-free diet. However, soya milk has a different smell from cow’s milk, and children may take some time to accept it. This can be overcome to a great extent if the child drinks from a nursing bottle or trainer cup rather than from an open cup. Soya protein itself can also cause allergic reactions in some children, in which case another alternative should be tried. Two types of soya milk are available. The first type, soya formula milk, is made for babies and younger children. Like cow’s milk formula, soya formula milk is “modified”, a treatment process by which the balance of protein, fat, carbohydrate and salt is altered to resemble more closely that found in human milk. It is also nutritionally complete, with a wide range of added vitamins and minerals (including calcium) which is important for good growth and development. Several brands are widely available from chemists’ shops, including “ProSobee®” (Mead Johnson), “Formula S®” (Cow and Gate) and “Wysoy®” (Wyeth). The second type, appropriate only for older children, is ready to drink liquid soya milk. Several brands are available in health food shops and some supermarkets. Please note that these ready to drink soya milks DO NOT usually contain adequate calcium (although they are nutritious in other ways) and are NOT, by themselves, appropriate substitutes for cow’s milk in a child’s diet. However, regular calcium supplements can make these acceptable for milk-free diets. Extensively Hydrolysate Formulas These are formulas where the protein source has been broken down to peptides. This removes aller- genic proteins, making the formula extremely unlikely to cause allergic reactions. All other compo- nents of ordinary cow’s milk formula (fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals) are then added and processed to make a modified feed resembling human milk in its nutritional value. Three such formu- las are currently available through chemist shops. They are “Pregestimil®”, “Nutramigen 1®” and “Nutramigen 2®” (both Mead Johnson), “Aptimil Pepti 1®” (for children less than 6 months old) and “Aptimil Pepti 2®”. These are suitable milk substitutes for infants and children, but must be fed strictly in accordance with instructions from your doctor and/or dietician. Like soya milk, these are unappealing to the adult palate, but most infants accept them as the innate drive of thirst and hunger will overcome the bitter taste. Unlike soya milk, these products very rarely cause an allergic response. For the extremely cow’s milk allergic child elemental formulas such as “Neocate LCP®”, “Neocate Active 1®” or “Neocate Advance®” should be tried. These formulas are more expensive than soya formula, but may be prescribable by your GP. 592 D. Buckley Goat’s Milk Goat’s milk has been used as a cow’s milk replacement with some success. However, we normally recommend soya milk or casein hydrolysate formula in preference to goat’s milk, for the following reasons. 1. Many of the proteins contained in goat’s milk are virtually indistinguishable from those in cow’s milk. Therefore, a change to goat’s milk may make little difference in a child’s symptoms. However, boiling goat’s milk may make the protein more acceptable to some allergic children. 2. Goat’s milk is not subject to the strict hygienic controls enforced in the production of milk from dairy cattle to guard against harmful bacteria. Goats are normally hand milked instead of machine milked, adding to the chances of contamination. Furthermore, goat’s milk is rarely pasteurised, while cow’s milk is always pasteurised. As a result when we have checked in our hospital the bacte- rial content of goat’s milk obtained from various sources, we have almost invariably found poten- tially harmful bacteria. If you do choose goat’s milk, we recommend that you boil it for 2 minutes. The milk can then be cooled and drunk cold. Unfortunately, boiling does make the flavour worse and reduces the content of some of the vitamins, especially folic acid, which is already low in goat’s milk. 3. Goat’s milk is entirely unsuitable for infants under 6 months of age. Un-boiled, it is positively dan- gerous, for the bacteria it often contains may cause a lethal infection in infants. Even when boiled, however it is hazardous for this age group because it is not “modified” and therefore lacks a normal balance of nutrients. 4. Goat’s milk may be difficult to find in retail stores, although availability has improved in recent years. It may be particularly scarce during the kidding season, when it is fed to baby goats. Goat’s milk is regularly stocked by health food shops and some supermarket chains and can be obtained directly from producers in some rural areas. It is available refrigerated or frozen in cartons or, more rarely, dried in tins. If you choose goats milk, we recommend refrigerated goat’s milk because it tends to be fresher than frozen milk and you can freeze it at home yourself for later use. Calcium Tablets If your child cannot or will not take sufficient amounts of one of these milk substitutes (more than ½ pint or 300 ml daily) it is important to provide adequate amounts of calcium in tablet form. Perhaps the most suitable are “Sandocal tablets®”, which contain very small amounts of E102 and E110 artificial colourings. One tablet should be taken daily, dissolved in water or orange juice. This provides more than enough calcium for most children. An alternative is Cox effervescent calcium gluconate tablets, which contain no added colourings, though up to six tablets daily may be required. The elimination of cow’s milk also means strict avoidance of: milk powders (full fat and semi- skimmed), cheese, cream, butter, yoghurt, non-fat milk solids, caseinates, lactalbumin, lactose, whey, margarines and shortening containing whey, whey syrup sweeteners. Suitable alternatives to butter and whey-based margarines are available from some supermarkets and health food shops. A cow’s-milk-free soya ice cream is also available from many health food shops. Food labels should be checked routinely as milk and its derivatives are used fairly frequently in processed foods. Even the labels of tried and trusted milk-free products should be regularly checked as manufacturers may change ingredients from time to time. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 593 Hidden Sources of Milk Remember to read the ingredients list before buying packets, tins or jars of baby food, in order to watch out for the “Hidden sources of milk” in manufactured foods. In ingredient listing and on food labels Casein Sodium Caseinate Caseinate Lactose Calcium Caseinate Whey Skimmed Milk Milk Protein Milk Sugar Whey Protein In foods Cheese Custards Cottage Cheese Some baked products (e.g. biscuits, bread rolls and cakes) Cream Cheese Certain cereals Butter Crackers Margarine Pancakes Cream Pasta Ice Cream Curds Yoghurt Gravy Creamed Soups and other Foods White Sauces Luncheon Meats and other processed meats, (e.g. hot Confectionary (especially chocolate) dogs, hamburgers) Crisps Puddings Note: this list highlights only a few of the foods to be avoided in a milk-free diet. It should not be used as a diet sheet and fully qualified dietary advice should be obtained 594 D. Buckley 66.3.2 Hand care tips for hand eczema and dermatitis 1. Constantly moisturise your hands at least five or ten times a day with a “safe” greasy moisturiser as recommended by your doctor or nurse (e.g. Emulsifying ointment, “Epiderm ointment®”, “Aveno Dermexa®” cream or “Neutrogena Hand Cream Unscented®”). Avoid cosmetic type moisturisers containing colours and perfumes on sensitive hands. 2. Keep your hands dry at all times by the careful use of gloves. Before wet work moisturise your hands with your recommended moisturiser and put on a pair of light cotton gloves available from pharmacies (e.g. “Seton Gloves”®) or First Communion gloves) followed by a pair of domestic rubber or PVC gloves for housework or industrial gloves for heavy work. Take a break every 15 min, remove the gloves and moisturise again. Cotton gloves by themselves are suitable for “dry” work around the house such as hoovering, polishing etc. Surgical latex gloves may be more suitable for delicate wet work. 3. Avoid direct hand contact with soaps, shampoos, washing up liquids and detergents. Use a wash- ing machine and dishwasher if at all possible. 4. Avoid hand washing. Get your gloves dirty, not your hands. If you have to wash your hands (e.g. after going to the toilet) never use soap. Use a recommended soap substitute such as “Elave Wash®” or aqueous cream with lukewarm water. Then dry your hands carefully and moisturise immediately with your recommended moisturiser. These soap substitutes can also be used in the bath or shower by placing a small amount on a sponge to clear the skin. Use an electric razor instead of wet shaving. 5. Use a detergent free shampoo such as “Elave shampoo®” or else wear surgical gloves when wash- ing your hair. 6. Rings should only be worn for special occasions, never during work. Avoid cheap jewellery (18 carat gold, solid silver or stainless steel are safe). 7. Buy plenty of gloves and hand moisturisers and place them in strategic places around the home and at work so that you don’t have to go looking for them every time you need them e.g. in the bathroom, kitchen, garage, car and at work. Keep small quantities of your hand moisturiser in a container in your hand bag or pocket to use throughout the day. 8. It may take many months for your hands to recover. Even after recovery you will still have to take great care of your hands to prevent relapse. 9. Pain, oozing, crusting or a sudden deterioration of your hand eczema/dermatitis may indicate that your skin has become infected. Check with your doctor, as you may need antibiotic tablets. 10. If your hands do not improve with these measures you may need to see your doctor to add in a topical steroid cream and perhaps to have some allergy testing such as a skin patch allergy test. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 595 66.3.3 Ketoconazole (“Nizoral®”) Shampoo Instructions for Use for Severe Dandruff, Seborrhoeic Dermatitis and/or Psoriasis 1. Use ketoconazole (“Nizoral”®) shampoo, ……………………….….times a week for 4 weeks. Then use once a week to prevent relapse. 2. Use the pink ketoconazole (“Nizoral”®) shampoo in the following way: a. Wash hair with your regular shampoo. Rinse out well and towel dry the hair. b. Apply one teaspoon full (two teaspoons full for long hair) of ketoconazole (“Nizoral”®) sham- poo to the scalp and work up into a rich lather. You may also rub some of the lather onto your face, ears and body if necessary. c. Leave it soak in for 3 min. d. Rinse out. e. If you have to use a conditioner, use it only on the ends of the hair; not in the scalp. f. Dry hair in the usual way. 3. For a more potent effect, rub in 5 ml (one teaspoon) of the shampoo into the dry scalp, leave soak in for 10 min, then wet the hair, work up into a lather and rinse out. 4. If you need to wash your hair between treatments, use your regular shampoo. If you have seborrhoeic dermatitis on the face, ears or groin, you may also apply 1% hydrocor- tisone cream mixed with miconazole nitrate antifungal, (e.g. “Daktakort Cream®”) or tacrolimus ointment (“Protopic®”) ointment sparingly to these areas, once or twice daily, till cleared. 596 D. Buckley 66.3.4 Management of Dry Sensitive Skin Conditions Many skin problems such as Eczema, Dermatitis and Psoriasis cause excessively dry skin, which sometimes become scaly and itchy. Almost all dry skin conditions will benefit from the careful use of moisturisers (emollients), which can be applied directly to the skin or mixed in bath water. The greas- ier the moisturiser the better for most dry skin conditions. However, some people find very greasy moisturisers messy. Some people prefer to use a greaser moisturiser at home and over the weekend and use a lighter moisturiser, which may be more cosmetically acceptable, at work and when out socially. Moisturisers For moisturisers to work properly and relieve itch, they need to be applied generously and frequently. For people suffering from hand eczema or dermatitis, moisturiser should be applied every hour to the hands and also after washing. If you suffer from generalised dry skin all over your body, you need to moisturise at least twice a day and also after baths or showers. Adequate quantities of moisturisers need to be prescribed. If you are applying a moisturiser all over the body twice a day then you would need approximately 1000 g of moisturisers in a month for an adult, or 500 gm of moisturiser every month for a child. Moisturisers should be fragrance and perfume free, hypo-allergic and cheap so that they can be used frequently and generously. Moisturisers should never be put on acne prone skin. Paraffin based moisturisers may be flamma- ble so stay away from naked flames when applying these products. Beware that clothes stained with a paraffin-based moisturiser may catch fire easily with matches, lighters, cigarettes or from a fireplace. Below is a list of recommended moisturisers graded according to how greasy they are. Some people like to get small samples (100 g) of various different moisturisers to try them out and see how they feel. By and large the greasiest moisturiser that can be tolerated is the best. Thick and “Epaderm Ointment®” 125 g, 500 g Greasy: Liquid paraffin/white soft paraffin in equal parts (“Paraffin Gel®”) (500 g) “Diprobase Ointment®” (50 g) “Hydromol ointment®” (Alliance Pharma Ltd) 125 g, 500 g “Hydrous ointment®” (500 g) “Double base Emollient Gel®” 100 g, 500 g Organic extra virgin coconut oil. 500 ml (from supermarkets) “Bioderma Atoderm Intensive®” 500 ml “La Roche Posay Lipikar Baum AP+®” (200/400 ml pump) for atopic dermatitis “La Roche Posay Cicaplast Mains®” (hand moisturiser) 50 ml “Eucerin Lotion®” 10% (250 ml) “Relife U-Life Cream®” (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% (A Menarini) “Childs Farm Moisturiser®” (unfragranced) (250 ml) “Moogoo Natural Full Cream Moisturiser®” (200 g) “Epaderm Cream®” (500 g) “Neutrogena dermatological hand cream®” (unscented) “Oilatum Cream Pump®” (500 ml) “Aveeno Dermexa cream®” 200 ml “Aveeno Daily moisturising lotion with colloidal oatmeal®” (200 ml, 354 ml) “La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra®” (40 ml) for extremely sensitive skin “La Roche Posay Effaclar H®” (40 ml) for dry acne prone skin “Cicabio Cream®” (40 + 100 ml) and “Cicabio SPF 50+®” (30 ml) (Bioderma) Light and “Diprobase cream®” (50 g or 500 g pump) Creamy: 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 597 Greasy moisturisers (e.g. emulsifying ointment) are generally better tolerated on the body but sometimes people prefer to use less greasy moisturiser on the face such as “Diprobase®”. This is also good for babies’ bottoms during nappy changes. Silcock’s Base (100 g + 500 g) is often promoted as a moisturiser but it is more of a cooling cream used to cool down the skin in conditions such as sunburn or facial flushing. Zinc and castor oil (100 g + 500 g) is a good lubricant and barrier for nappy rash and itchy bottoms. For dry lips “Carmex Lips®”, “Nutragena Lips®” or “Atoderm Stick®” (Bioderma) are good. When applying moisturisers to the body, the ointment should be always rubbed downwards gen- tly in the direction of the hairs, as you would stroke a cat, going with the fur. Rubbing upwards against the hairs can irritate the skin and cause low-grade infection in the hair roots (folliculitis). Some people find that placing a thick moisturiser such as emulsifying ointment on a radiator, win- dowsill or in the hot press keeps it softer and easier to apply. When moisturisers are used liberally, people with dry skin conditions often need less prescription medication such as anti-itch tablets or topical steroids. As a rule, you should use 10 time more moisturiser as topical steroid. Emollients with the same generic name can be manufactured by different companies. You may find a variation from one company’s ointment to another’s. Bath Emollients “Oilatum®” do a range of bath emollients which easily dissolve in water and are a simple way of moisturising the skin. Nothing else should be added to the bath water, such as bubble baths, “Baby Bath”, “T–tree oil” etc. Below is a list of bath emollients with the usual indications. • “Oilatum bath emollient®”: 20 ml in a bath is suitable for adults (comes in bottles of 100, 250 and 500 ml). • “Oilatum Plus Bath Emollient®”: 20 ml in a bath is suitable for adults when their skin is infected. • “Oilatum Junior Bath Emollient®”: 10 ml in a bath is suitable for children. • “Oilatum Junior Flare—up Bath Emollient®”: 5 ml in a bath is suitable for children greater than 6 months old with infected eczema or • “Emulsiderm Emollient®” (Dermal): (300 ml bottle)—30 ml in a bath for an adult, 10–20 ml in a child’s bath. • “Aveeno Colloidal Bath Powder®” with colloidal Oatmeal. Dissolve in bath water as instructed on package. • “Hydromol Bath and Shower Emollient®”: 1–3 capful in an 8-inch bath. Infants = Half to 2 cap. • “Milton Sterilizing Fluid®”: 120 ml (4 capfuls) in 100 l bath (= a half full adult bath): or half capful in a half full baby bath = Max 2 baths/week (1 ml of “Milton®” per litre of bathwater). • Water temperature = 28–30 °C. Do not stay in bath more than 3–5 min. • Alternatively, two dessertspoons full of Emulsifying ointment can be added to two pints of boil- ing water and beaten with a fork or whisk until all lumpiness has gone and a creamy liquid remains. This can be poured into a warm bath and mixed thoroughly to provide a cheap bath emollient that is available on the medical card. However, this does not mix through the bath water as good as the special bath oils mentioned above. • Bath mats should be used to avoid slipping in the bath when using bath emollients. • “Psoriderm Bath Emulsion®” 200 ml useful for psoriasis. Soap Substitutes It is important that people with dry skin conditions do not use soaps or shampoos, as this will dry out the skin even further. “Elave Wash®”, “Elave Shower Gel®”, “La Roche Posay Lipikar Syndet Wash®” (200 ml/400 ml), “Hydromol Bath and Shower Emollient®”, “Aveeno Dermexa Body Wash®” for very dry skin or “Aveeno Daily Moisturising Body Wash®” or “Bioderma 598 D. Buckley Atoderm Shower Oil®” (1 l) are good soap free washes that can be used for hand and body wash- ing in the bath or shower. Other options include “Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleaners®”, “Cetaphil Skin Restoring Body Wash®” (Galderma) or “Sanex Hypoallergenic Shower Gel®”. “Elave Shampoo®” or “Bioderma NODE Shampoo®” is safe for hair washing. Alternatively, Aqueous Cream (100 g or 500 g) can be used as a soap substitute by gently massaging a small amount of it on to the skin and washing off with warm water. This can be used for hand washing or for shower- ing. This is a cheap alternative as a soap substitute and is available on the medical card. Do not leave Aqueous Cream on the skin as a moisturiser. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 599 66.3.5 Milton Baths Some parents notice that their child’s eczema may benefit from being in chlorinated swimming- pool water due to its antiseptic effects. These instructions make an antiseptic bath at home with a similar concentration to a chlorinated swimming pool: 1. Add Milton Sterilising Fluid® (MSF) followed by lukewarm water into the bath tub. 2. 125 ml of Milton® (MSF) in 60 l of water (roughly ½ bath full) or 62 ml of Milton® Sterilising Fluid in 30 l of water (roughly ¼ bath full) 3. Stir the mixture with the jug to make sure that the bleach is completely diluted in the bath water. 4. The patient should soak up to their neck in the chlorinated water for approximately 5 min. Be care- ful not to get it in your eyes. 5. Thoroughly rinse skin with lukewarm clean water at the end of the bleach bath to prevent dryness and irritation. 6. As soon as the bath is over, pat dry. Do not rub dry as this has the same effect as scratching. 7. Immediately apply any prescribed moisturiser and other treatments. 8. Repeat bleach baths twice weekly or as prescribed by your doctor. Cautions • Do not use undiluted bleach directly on the skin. Even diluted bleach can potentially cause dryness and irritation. • Do not use bleach baths with a known contact allergy to chlorine. • Do not use bleach baths without first taking medical advice from your doctor. • Before the first bath test the MSF, diluted as above, on a small area of non-eczematous skin. Rinse off after 10 min and wait for 24 h to make sure you don’t have a reaction to it. Only use “Milton Sterilising Fluid®”. DO NOT use any other type of household bleach. 600 D. Buckley 66.3.6 Tacrolimus (“Protopic®”) + pimecrolimus (Elidel®) Tacrolimus (“Protopic®” ointment) and pimecrolimus (“Elidel® cream”) are topical immunomodulat- ing agent of the calcineurin inhibitor class used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults and children over the age of two, when they are not responding to topical steroids or not able to tolerate topical steroids (cortisone creams). Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus have a number of advantages over topical steroids in the treatment of atopic eczema and other skin conditions. Advantages • They are as potent as a potent topical steroid in the treatment of atopic eczema but has none of the steroid side effects such as skin thinning, skin redness, or growth retardation. • They are effective at both settling down a flare of atopic eczema and also for preventing relapse. • They can be used on the face and body including the flexures (folds of skin such as the groin and under the arms). They are available for both children over the age of two and adults. • Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus may be used off-licence for a number of other skin conditions such as facial and flexural psoriasis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, vitiligo and erosive lichen planus. Despite all these advantages with tacrolimus and, pimecrolimus, topical steroids are still the first line of treatment for most adults and children with atopic eczema and topical steroids are considered safe and effective when used under careful medical supervision (see our separate sheet on safe use of topical steroids). Tacrolimus and Pimecrolimus Can Have a Number of Disadvantages • They are considerably more expensive than topical steroids. • They can cause temporary redness and irritation at the site of application in up to 50% of patients during the first week of use. Most of these flare-ups will settle in the second or subsequent weeks (i.e. “It can get worse before it gets better”). • Ten per cent of patients cannot tolerate tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, even after the first week of use and they will have to use a different form of treatment. • Tacrolimus cannot be used on infected skin (i.e. if the skin is sore rather than itchy or if it is weepy or crusty instead of being dry, these are signs of infection.) Infection needs to be managed with appropriate antibiotic or anti-v iral agent either topically or orally before starting these drugs. • Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus can cause facial flushing after consuming alcohol in some patients. • Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are not licenced for children under the age of two in most countries, although some skin specialists use them in this age group for severe eczema, as it is probably safer than using potent topical steroids in this age group. • Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus may interfere with live vaccines such as the MMR or the BCG. Special precautions may be required before giving these vaccines. • There is a possibility that tacrolimus and pimecrolimus might make a patient more at risk of cancer such as skin cancer. This can be minimised by protecting the skin from ultra violet light by the appropriate use of clothing, hats and high factor sunblocks when using these agents on exposed areas such as the face and hands. Never use tanning beds when using tacrolimus or pimecrolimus. However, a direct link with these drugs and cancer has not been proven. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 601 How Is Tacrolimus and Pimecrolimus Used? Tacrolimus comes in two strengths (0.1% for adults and children over the age of sixteen and 0.03% for children from 2 years old to 16 years old) and in two sizes (30 g and 60 g). Pimecrolimus comes as a cream and in only in one strength (1 g of cream contains 10 mg of pimecrolimus which can be used in children over the age of 2 years and in adults. They should be applied to all the areas affected with atopic eczema, twice a day for 3 weeks and then once a day for a further 3 weeks. For preventative use, once the atopic eczema has settled down, apply tacrolimus or pimecrolimus to the areas where you previously had atopic eczema twice a week to prevent relapse. Preventative treatment needs to be reviewed every 6–12 months by your doctor. When using tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, you should avoid soaps, bubble baths, shower gels, wash- ing up liquids and detergents. Use a suitable soap-free wash and soap-free shampoos. You should moisturise regularly with a good greasy moisturiser as recommend by your doctor. Leave 2 h after applying tacrolimus or pimecrolimus before applying a moisturiser. For more information on tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, read the information leaflet that is included in the box that comes with your cream. Please store the tube in a cool, dry place with the cap on and away from direct heat and sunlight. Please keep all medicine out of reach and sight of children. Do not share your prescription treatment with others. 602 D. Buckley 66.3.7 Topical Steroids; There safe use • Topical steroids are very effective anti-i nflammatories that will reduce itch and inflammation in a wide range of skin conditions. They have been on the market since the 1950s and there is nothing we don’t know about them. • Used properly, under careful medical supervision, topical steroids are very safe and effective in adults and children. Topical steroids are also known as topical corticosteroids but they are com- pletely different than anabolic steroids used and abused by body builders and athletes. Topical steroids much safe than oral steroid tablets or steroid injections. • Like all medications, topical steroids can cause side effects. Topical side effects which rarely occur include skin thinning or broken veins. Topical steroids may trigger or worsen acne, rosacea or peri- oral dermatitis. Generalised side effects can occasionally occur if very strong topical steroids are applied to large parts of the body in high quantities over a prolonged period of time. These gener- alised side effects might include raised blood pressure, diabetes or stunted growth. Your doctor will instruct you on which topical steroid to use on which particular area of the body and how much can be safely used for an adult or a child. • Topical steroids come in different strengths or potencies (see Table 66.1). We usually start with a stronger strength topical steroid and reduce the frequency of application or the potency of the topi- cal steroid as the underlying condition improves. • Topical steroids will do nothing for dry skin. If your skin is dry you should moisturise regularly with a safe, greasy moisturiser as recommended by your doctor. By and large, you should use ten times more moisturisers compared to the amount of topical steroids you use per month. You should avoid soaps, shampoos, bubble baths, washing up liquids, etc. Wear gloves to protect your hands and use a suitable soap free wash and shampoo. • Mildly potent topical steroids such as 1% Hydrocortisone is safe on the face and in the folds of skin (e.g. under the armpit or in the groin) even in children. • Moderately potent topical steroids such as hydrocortisone butyrate (“Eumovate®”) can be safely used on the body in children and adults but is best avoided on the face. • Potent topical steroids such as betamethasone dipropionate (“Betnovate®” or “Diprisone®”), hydrocortisone butyrate (“Locoid®”) or mometasone furoate (“Elocon®”) can be safely used on the body in adults but should not be used on the face and should only be used on the body in children for a short period of time (e.g. 1 to 2 weeks) if there is a severe skin problem. • Very potent topical steroids like clobetasol propionate (e.g. “Dermovate®”) are rarely necessary in adults. They should never be put on the face and are unsuitable for children on any part of the body (Table 66.2). • A fingertip unit is a convenient way of measuring the amount of topical steroid required to cover an area the equivalent of two adult palms, including the fingers. A fingertip unit is the amount of cream or ointment that comes out of the opening of a standard tube with a 5 mm nozzle that extends from the tip of an adult index finder to the first finger crease. This is approximately 0.5 g.

EADV (2005)19,286–295 b4 times this amount can be prescribed if using “Betnovate RD” Fig. 66.1 Finger tip unit measurement Figure 66.1 shows how much topical storied is safe to use on different parts of the body and in dif- ferent age groups. These amounts are safe when used over weeks or months. Higher amounts can be safely used for 1–2 weeks for a severe flare up of eczema or dermatitis. • Generally speaking, topical steroids with an ointment base are safer and more effective than the same potency topical steroid in a cream base. • Please do not stop your topical steroids suddenly. Try to wean off it slowly over a few weeks by gradually reducing the amount, the frequency of application (e.g. alternate days) and/or the potency of the topical steroid as the underlying skin condition improves. • Topical steroids are suitable for dry, itchy eczema. They should not be put on infected skin which is usually suspected if the skin condition becomes sore, weepy or crusty. If you think your skin is infected please contact your doctor immediately as you may need an antibiotic. 604 D. Buckley 66.3.8 Wet wraps 1. Gather supplies. a. Topical steroid as prescribed by your doctor. b. Emollient of choice (e.g., Emulsifying ointment or “Epiderm ointment®”) c. Wraps consisting of an inner wet layer and a top, dry layer to go over the wet layer. Gauze wraps such as “Tubifast tubular dressings®”, “Tubifast Garments®” or the “Comfi range®”, (all available from Amazon, E Bay or your local pharmacy) or tightly fitting cotton T shirt, tights, sleepers, or long johns may be used. It is necessary to have two sets of the chosen material on hand (a wet layer to be in contact with the skin and a dry layer to be placed over the wet layer). Remove labels and wear the garment inside out if they have rough seems. d. Warm water in a sink or a basin. 2. Apply the moisturiser generously to the child’s dry skin rubbing downwards. 3. Immediately after applying the moisturiser, apply the topical steroid to itchy areas of child’s skin placing it on top of the moisturiser in the badly affected areas. Use the “fingertip units” to calcu- late how much topical steroid to apply (one “fingertip unit” is the amount of ointment squeezed out form a tube to spread form the last finger crease to the tip of an adults finger; this amount of ointment is enough to covers an area equivalent to the palms of 2 adults hands) 4. Soak a single layer of tubular dressing or garment in warm water. 5. Wring out excess water so that the dressing or garment is only slightly damp. 6. Cover the affected area of skin with a damp layer of the tubular dressing or garment, making sure not to wrap too tightly. 7. Immediately place a dry layer of material over the damp layer. 8. Keep child in a warm, humid environment to ensure that the child does not grow cold as the evaporation process occurs. Leave wraps in place overnight. 9. Change wraps once daily for up to 14 days in a row or as instructed by your doctor. 10. Maintain close contact with your doctor while using wet wraps technique. Report any suspected side effects or concerns immediately. Wet wraps cannot be used if the skin is infected (i.e. weepy, crusty or sore) 11. See YouTube video entitled: “Wet Wrapping Technique” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVgQ7eLjJcY 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 605 66.4 Hair Loss 66.4.1 Hair Loss in Men For most men with male pattern hair loss, trying to accept the problem is probably the best approach. Some men will be happy to grow and fashion their hair to cover the affected areas. Others may choose to shave their scalp or wear a hair piece or wig. Volumising shampoo and conditioners may help. (e.g. “Nanogen Thickening Treatment Shampoo®”; available in Boots or try your local pharmacy). Another cosmetic option is hair fibres (e.g. “Nanogen Hair Thickening Fibres®”). This releases thousands of microscopic colour- matched hair fibres, which bind electrostatically individual hair giv- ing the appearance of a fuller head of hair. These can be made wind and waterproof with various locking mists (e.g. “Nanogen Fibre Locking Spray®”). Lightning the hair colour to bend in with the white scalp may help camouflage the hair loss pro- cess. Alternatively, temporary scalp dies can safely blends scalp and hair colour together to conceal areas or thinning hair (e.g. “Nanogen Aquamatch Waterproof Concealer®”). Vitamin supplements promoted for hair and nail growth such as biotin 2.5 mg/day (a B complex vitamins also known as vitamin H that may improve the keratin infrastructure such as “Viviscal®” and “Pantogar®”, may help some men. There are thousands of herbal and homeopathic products available on the internet and in retail outlets that are promoted for hair loss but the vast majority have little or no benefits and have not gone through any serious clinical trials. However, people with hair loss are often desperate, gullible and naive and may try anything that has glossy marketing and convincing websites, despite lack of scientific evidence that they actually work. Minoxidil (Regain®) is the only topical treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in male pattern hair loss. Although its exact mechanism of action is unclear, minoxidil opens potassium channels and was originally approved as an oral treatment for hypertension. However, results to date with topical minoxidil is not great. Significant regrowth, which is clinically apparent, is rare. In the majority of patients the most that one can expect is a slowing down of the rate of hair loss but some patients are quite happy to accept even this limited response. The 5% foam is probably more effective but may cause scalp irritation. Topical minoxi- dil should not be used if there is any underlying scaly disease or irritation. It should be continued twice a day for at least 4–6 months before deciding if there is any improvement. There may be a temporary shedding of hair in the first 4–6 weeks of use before re-growth starts. If there is some improvement, minoxidil can be continued once a day or three times per week for months or years. Best results occur if it is started early in the hair loss process. If the treatment is stopped any hair that has been ‘saved’ will gradually fall out. Oral drug such as finasteride or dunasteride may be used for hair loss but these are only available on prescription from a doctor. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) and low-level laser light therapy (LLLT) have also been tried with varying degrees of success. Hair transplantation using follicular unit transfer, when performed by an experienced surgeon, can give excellent results but is expensive. Hair piece, hair extensions or a wig are cheaper and more acceptable approaches for some men with severe hair loss. 606 D. Buckley 66.4.2 Hair Loss in Women Hair thinning in women can be very upsetting and worrying. However, most women with hair thin- ning will never progress to the stage where they may need a wig. Many women will be happy to grow and fashion their hair to cover the thinned out areas. Volumising shampoo and conditioners may help. (e.g. “Nanogen Thickening Treatment Shampoo”; available in Boots or try your local pharmacy). Another cosmetic option is hair fibres (e.g. “Nanogen Hair Thickening Fibres”). This releases thousands of microscopic colour- matched hair fibres, which bind electrostatically individual hair giv- ing the appearance of a fuller head of hair. These can be made wind and waterproof with various locking mists (e.g. “Nanogen Fibre Locking Spray”). Lightning the hair colour to blend in with the white scalp may help camouflage the hair loss pro- cess. Alternatively, temporary scalp dies can safely blends scalp and hair colour together to conceal areas or thinning hair. (e.g. “Nanogen Aquamatch Waterproof Concealer”). Some women may need investigations to rule out an underlying hormonal problem (e.g. polycystic ovarian syndrome or thyroid diseases) or nutritional deficiency (e.g. iron deficiency). A scalp biopsy may be necessary in severe cases or hair loss or if there is scaring in the scalp. Alopecia areata (round patches of hair loss on any part of the scalp) may respond to strong steroid scalp lotions or injections into the affected areas of the scalp. Vitamin supplements promoted for hair and nail growth such as biotin 2.5 mg/day (a B complex vitamins also known as vitamin H that may improve the keratin infrastructure such as “Viviscal” and “Pantogar”, may help some women but should be avoided in pregnancy. There are thousands of herbal and homeopathic products available on the internet and in retail outlets that are promoted for hair loss but the vast majority have little or no benefits and have not gone through any serious clinical trials. However, people with hair loss are often desperate, gullible and naive and may try anything that has glossy marketing and convincing websites, despite lack of scientific evidence that they actually work. Minoxidil (Regain) is the only topical treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in pattern hair loss in both sexes. Although its exact mechanism of action is unclear, 3% minoxidil opens potassium channels and was originally approved as an oral treatment for hyper- tension. However, results to date with topical minoxidil is not great. Significant regrowth, which is clinically apparent, is rare. In the majority of patients the most that one can expect is a slowing down of the rate of hair loss but some patients are quite happy to accept even this limited response. The 5% foam is probably more effective but may cause scalp irritation. Topical minoxidil should not be used if there is any underlying scaly disease or irritation. It should be continued twice a day for at least 4–6 months before deciding if there is any improvement. There may be a temporary shedding of hair in the first 4–6 weeks of use before re-growth starts. If there is some improvement, minoxidil can be continued once a day or three times per week for months or years. Best results occur if it is started early in the hair loss process. If the treatment is stopped any hair that has been ‘saved’ will gradually fall out. Occasionally oral drug such as finasteride or dunasteride may be used for hair loss in post meno- pausal women but they cannot be used in women of childbearing age. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) and low-level laser light therapy (LLLT) have also been tried with varying success. Hair transplantation using follicular unit transfer, when performed by an experienced surgeon, can give excellent results but is expensive. Hair piece, hair extensions or wigs are cheaper and more acceptable approaches for many women with severe hair loss. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 607 66.5 Infections and Infestations 66.5.1 All about Warts Although now we know that warts and verrucae are caused by a virus and are therefore contagious, there is still much to learn about the nature of the condition. Why is it, for example, that some people tend to contract warts more readily than others? And why do some warts disappear overnight for no apparent reason? Whatever the answer to these questions, it is clear than many people suffer pain and embarrassment because of their warts. Modern treatment can, when properly applied, go a long way towards alleviating the problem. There are numerous traditional “cures” for warts such as “the first spit in the morning”, banana skins, duct tape, etc. One cure is “The Crossroad Remedy”. The wart sufferer should rub the warts with stones, which is then wrapped in a brown paper bag and left at a local crossroad. Some inquisitive person picking them up would, by handling the stones, heal the patient and acquire warts himself over the following 6–12 months. Another popular “cure” is to visit a holy well that has the cure for warts. The person with the warts has to go to the holy well and wash the affected areas in water from the well while saying a prayer. Verrucae (Plantar Warts) are ingrown warts on the foot and they are contagious. They are caused by a virus entering the foot via a slight area of damage. Swimming pools and changing rooms are common sources of infection and hence children are frequent verrucae sufferers. Genital warts (on the penis or the vagina) are usually sexually transmitted and always need inves- tigation and treatment by a doctor. Modern treatment for warts is usually achieved by the use of topical creams or gels from the chem- ist or the doctor. If this fails then your doctor might consider the use of cryosurgery in people over the age of 12 years and occasionally in children 6 to 12 years old. Cryosurgery Cryosurgery is a method of freezing the wart using very cold liquids such as liquid nitrogen, which is usually sprayed onto the wart using special hand-held cryoguns. This creates a local- ised frostbite or cold burn, which selectively destroys the wart without damaging underlying structures. Freezing small warts using cryosurgery causes minimal discomfort and can usually be tolerated by most adults without local anaesthetic. Larger warts (greater than 5 mm) can be more painful to treat and therefore your doctor may suggest using local anaesthetic prior to treatment to numb the area much the same as the dentist would numb a tooth before a filling. 75–90% of warts on the hands and feet should clear with one single treatment using cryosurgery when the procedure is properly carried out an experienced Cryosurgeon. However if someone has numerous warts on their hands or feet, the doctor may not treat all the warts in one session. After the treatment the frozen area will swell up and may blister like a burn. It usually heals within 2–6 weeks without scarring. 608 D. Buckley 66.5.2 Patients instructions on detection and treatment of head lice Confirm the diagnosis by find combing wet hair, with conditioner looking for a living, moving louse under good light. • Start with the teeth of the detection comb touching the skin of the scalp at the top of the head. Draw the comb carefully towards the edge of the hair. • Look carefully at the teeth of the comb in good light. • Do this over and over again from the top of the head to the edge of the hair in all directions, work- ing around the head. • Head lice are little insects with moving legs. They are often not much bigger than a pinhead, but may be as big as a sesame seed (the seed on a burger bun). Use a head lice lotion, cream or foam (not a shampoo) if you find a living, moving louse. If you find “nits” (empty egg shells stuck to the hair shafts) and the person has an itchy scalp and has not been recently treated for head lice, it is reasonable to assume they have head lice and should be treated. • Part the hair near the top of the head, put a few drops on to the scalp and rub it into the scalp and 3 cm down the hair shaft. Part the hair a bit further down the scalp and do the same again. Do this over and over again until the whole scalp is wet. • Read the manufacturer’s instructions as to how long the lotion, cream or foam should be left on, before washing out. (Lyclear cream rinse—10 min, Derbac M—12 h). • Check all household contacts and all best friends for a living, moving louse. • Anybody with a living, moving louse should be treated with a head lice lotion, cream or foam (not a shampoo). • Re-treat after seven days to clear any new lice that have hatched out from eggs that survived the first treatment. • Re-check all treated scalps two days after the second treatment, to confirm there is no living, mov- ing lice. • The itch may take 2 weeks to subside and the “nits” (empty egg shells) can last a lot longer. Do not retreat unless you find a living, moving louse. • In resistant cases, fine comb for 30 min, once every 4 days, for 2 weeks, to physically remove the lice. We recommend the following head lice treatment ___________________ 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 609 66.5.3 Treating Fungal Nail Infections with terbinafine (“Lamisil®”) Anti-fungal Tablets Before taking a course of tablet treatment for fungal nail infection, diagnosis has to be confirmed by the doctor taking nail clippings from one or more of the affected nails and sending it to the hospital lab for fungal, stain and culture. It usually takes a month to get the full results back as fungus grows very slowly in the lab. If the nail clippings confirm that there is a fungal nail infection which is sensitive to terbinafine tablets, the doctor will arrange to take routine bloods from you before starting a 3 month course of terbinafine tablets. It is important that you have your bloods checked before starting the course of treatment and have the bloods repeated 1 month into the course of treatment to ensure the tablets are not causing any side effects. Side effects from terbinafine tablets are rare but occasionally they can cause nausea, a generalised rash or liver problems. Should you develop any signs or symptoms sug- gestive of liver disease such as itch, unexplained persistent nausea, decreased appetite, jaundice (yel- low eyes and skin), vomiting, tiredness, right upper tummy pain, dark urine, or pale stools please stop the tablets immediately and let the doctor who prescribed the tablets know. The doctor will usually give you a prescription for the first month of the tablets and will not give you the prescription for the last 2 months until your bloods have been checked after completing the first month of tablet treatment. On completion of the 3 month course of treatment your nails will still look unsightly and perhaps crumbly. It will take a further 9 months for the nails to grow out clear. Terbinafine tablets are usually about 85% effective at clearing Trichophyton rubrum which is the most common fungus to infect toenails. Some patients may get re-infected by the fungus a few years later. The chances of this can be reduced by wearing leather shoes in winter and open toe sandals in the summer to let the air at the feet. You should also be careful not to walk around barefoot anywhere. Wear shoes, slippers or flip-flops in the family home, in public places such as swimming pools, chang- ing rooms, gymnasiums and hotels. If you are worried that there may be fungal residue in your footwear, please sprinkle miconazole nitrate 2% w/w powder (“Daktarin®” powder) into all your shoes once at night for 7 days at the start of the 3 month course of terbinafine tablets. In Summary, This is the Normal Schedule for Treating Fungal Nail Infections On your first visit, the doctor will take nail clippings for fungal, stain and culture and will also take routine blood tests. After 1 month, you can phone for the results. If the fungal clippings grow fungus which is sensitive to terbinafine tablets and if your routine blood tests are normal, the doctor will post you out a prescrip- tion for 1 month of terbinafine tablets, 250 mg once daily. You should also sprinkle you shoes with miconazole nitrate 2% w/w powder (“Daktarin Powder®”) daily for 1 week. After completing 1 month of the tablets, you return to the nurse for routine blood tests. The nurse will organise for the doctor to issue another 2 months supply of terbinafine tablets on the same day (i.e. 3 months in total). It will take 9–12 months after finishing the tablets before you notice the nails growing clear. Should you require any further information please talk to your doctors or nurse. 610 D. Buckley 66.5.4 Treatment of Scabies We recommend the following treatment: Permethrin 5% w/w Cream (“Lyclear Dermal Cream®”). 66.5.4.1 Instructions for Use 1. The person with scabies and all their household contacts and close personal contacts (e.g. girl- friend, boyfriend, and child minder) need to be treated. 2. Apply the cream or lotion from your neck downwards covering every square inch of your body. Pay particular attention to applying the lotion all over the hands, wrists, feet, ankles, armpits, but- tocks and groin. The lotion can be applied with your hand or with a 2″ paint brush. 3. After the lotion or cream has been in contact with the skin for 12 h (e.g. overnight) you may have a bath or shower and wash it all off. Reapply the lotion or cream in the same way 1 week later. Change your bed linen, underwear and towels and launder them at 60 degrees centigrade after the first treatment. 4. Reapply cream or lotion to the hands if you wash them during the 12-h treatment period. 5. Two applications of the lotion is sufficient. The itch may persist for up to a week or two after the treatment and may require a steroid cream to the itchy areas for a few days after the scabies treatment. Do not apply the treatment more than two times without consulting with your doctor. If the itch hasn’t settled 2 weeks after the second treatment please return to your doctor. Nodules in the genital areas may last a number of weeks after treatment and a steroid cream may be required to treat these itchy bumps. 6. Small children (<2 years old), elderly patients and anyone with a weakened immune system should also have their face and scalp treated. Otherwise, these people should be treated the same as adults, as outlined above. Pregnant women should use the same treatment as for babies under 6 months of age. 7. Remember, scabies is common and harmless. However, it can cause a very uncomfortable itch. It is contagious and all close personal contacts and household contacts need to be treated whether they are itching or not. 8. Make sure you have enough liquid or cream to treat everyone who needs it. Adults need 100 ml of lotion or 30 g tube of cream per treatment (i.e. 200 ml bottle of lotion or two 30 g tubes of cream for the full treatment). Children 5–12 years of age will need half this amount; children 1–5 years of age will need quarter of adult amount, children 2 months to 1 year will need one-eighth of the adult amount. Do not use in children less than 2 months old. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 611 66.6 Skin Cancer 66.6.1 5 Fluorouracil (“Effudix®”) 1. Rub a thin smear of the ointment into the “sun spots” once or twice a day. Use very little ointment but rub it in well. 2. After 4 weeks, the part you have been treating will be red and sore. Stop using the ointment for the next 4 weeks, so that the inflammation can settle down. Then start using the ointment again as before, for another 4 weeks. 3. Continue using the ointment for 4-week periods and resting for 4-week periods until the spot has completely disappeared. Then continue a little longer to destroy any seeds. 4. If possible, avoid using the ointment for 1 week before you are due to be examined at the clinic, as the doctor cannot see if the spot is cured when the area is inflamed. 5. Sunlight will make the reaction much worse. Shield the “sun spots” from the hot sun. If necessary you can cover it. 6. If the inflammation should become very severe or painful, contact your doctor. 7. Do not use this ointment for any other purpose, nor apply it to other spots or rashes, nor give it to anyone else, as it can be harmful if used in the wrong circumstances. Keep away from the eyes, nose, mouth, genitals and anus. 8. Do not treat an area of skin larger that 23 × 23 cm (9 × 9 inches) at any one time (approximately the size of a dinner plate). 612 D. Buckley 66.6.2 Primary Melanomas You recently had a small operation on your skin and examination of the sample under the microscope showed that the problem was a melanoma, a type of skin cancer. You may have a lot of questions and worries, and the purpose of this leaflet is to help with some of them, but not to be a substitute for a good conversation with your doctor. It is a good idea to: • Write down all the questions you would like answered and bring them to your next visit. • Bring another family member or close friend so that you can both discuss the information after your visit and be sure that you both have the same memory of what was said. This will help your family understand what has happened which makes it in turn easier for you to cope with a worrying situation. How Will I Be Followed Up? Your melanoma was in the skin and has been removed by either one or two operations. After these the majority of people who have had melanomas of a similar thickness as yours remain well with no fur- ther problems, but because just over one in ten do develop signs of melanoma spread, we plan to see you back at the clinic for regular check-ups. At these visits, we will: • Look at and feel your scar. • Check the lymph glands in your groin or armpit to be sure none are bigger than normal. • Give you a total body skin examination to be sure that you do not have another small early treatable melanoma (once you have had one melanoma you are at increased risk of developing a second so we aim to identify and treat this as soon as possible.) Some people with melanoma have a very large number of moles. If you are in this group we may take photographs of some of these moles, and compare your skin with these photos at your next clinic visits. Not everyone needs these photographs. You should have a full skin check up every 6–12 months for the first 5 years after your diagnose and then yearly for the rest of your life. If you have any new or changing skin lesions you are concerned about between visits we will always see you early so do not hesitate to phone and ask for your appointment to be brought forward. Why Did I Get a Melanoma? We also want to know the answer to this question so that we can try to prevent other people developing melanoma in the future. In about two thirds of people with melanoma, too much sun exposure is important. This may be a childhood spent in a sunny country, or a history of many sunny summer holi- days, particularly if you remember severe sunburn with blistering or peeling. People with melanoma are usually white skinned and have pale skin which does not tan easily but goes red in the sun. They area often fair or red haired, have blue eyes and may have a lot of both moles and freckles. However, about one third of people with melanoma do not fit into the group described above and may have inherited genes which makes them more likely to develop melanoma. Research in this area is still ongoing. Are My Children More Likely to Get Melanoma? One melanoma patient in 50 has a history of melanoma in a close relative. If you area in this group your children could be at increased risk. In these families we offer regular skin examinations to all family members. If you do not have a close relative who has also had melanoma your children are not 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 613 at greater risk, but most families that have had a person with melanoma become very careful and sensible about avoiding sun burning. If any of your family members have unusual moles on their skin, which you would like us to check, we would be happy to see them. What Do I Do Now? Most people with melanoma do not tolerate sunbathing well and sunburn could increase your risk of a second melanoma. We therefore suggest that you become very sensible over sun exposure. This does not mean never having a holiday in a sunny country but it does mean avoiding strong noonday sun. Comfortable cotton clothing is an excellent sunscreen, so plan your holiday wardrobe around long cotton trousers or skirts, long sleeved cotton tops and a broad-rimmed hat. Sunscreen creams, even those called total sunblock, have not yet been shown to protect against melanoma. They do prevent sunburn, so use them as part of your skin protection routine, but not in place of clothing. Oral sun protection is also available in some countries and can be used in addition to the topical sun creams. Further Information Please ask us any other questions that are important to you. Women may want to ask about future pregnancies, use of the oral contraceptive or hormone replacement therapy. Advice is best tailored to you personally so do tell us your personal worries. Although there is a large amount of information on the Internet, most of it is aimed at the minority of patients whose melanoma has spread beyond their skin. It therefore does not apply to you, and you may find it unnecessarily alarming. Warning Signs to Look out for in a Mole Melanomas usually arise from freckles or moles. The warning signs to look out for is any one of the following three major signs: • A mole or freckle that is getting bigger (change in size). • Or A mole or freckle that is changing in shape: • Most moles are round or oval with a symmetrical shape. • When a mole develops an irregular border, it is a bad sign. • Or A mole or freckle that changes colour: • Most moles are an even shade of light or dark brown. • When a mole develops irregular shades of colour it is a bad sign. If any of your moles develop any one of the above signs you should contact your doctor immedi- ately as early detection and removal of a melanoma can be life saving. Other minor warning signs to look out for in a mole or a freckle are as follows: – Itch – Size greater than the head of a pencil (i.e. >7 mm). – Bleeding or crusting – Inflammation 614 D. Buckley 66.6.3 Skin cancer screening These are the warning signs that a lesion (a growth, a sore a freckle or a mole) that is present for more than 6–12 weeks may be turning cancerous in adults: “New Cancers Do Show” • New—A new growth, sore, freckle or mole in the last 6–12 months. • Changing—A growth, sore, freckle or mole that is changing in size, shape or color over the past 6–12 months. • Different—A growth, sore, freckle or mole that looks, feels or behaves differently from any other growth, sore or mole on the body (the “ugly duckling”). • Sore—A growth, sore, freckle or mole that is sore, tender to touch, bleeding or itchy and will not heal after 6–12 weeks. If a growth, sore, freckle or mole shows one or more of these warning signs it should be checked by your doctor. The more warning signs, the greater the risk of skin cancer. Early detection saves lives! 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 615 66.6.4 Skin cancer. What to look out for There are two main types of skin cancer, melanomas and non-melanoma skin cancers. Melanomas—This is the most serious and dangerous type of skin cancer. They are also called “malignant melanoma”. They grow rapidly, spread early and can be fatal. They usually arise from freckles or moles. The warning signs to look out for are any one of the following three major signs: • A mole or freckle that is getting bigger (changing in size). • Or A mole or freckle that is changing in shape: most moles are round or oval with a symmetrical shape. When a mole develops an irregular border it is a bad sign. • Or A mole or freckle that is changing in colour: most moles are an even shade of light or dark brown. When a mole develops irregular shades of colour it is a bad sign. Some melanomas may be red or flesh coloured. If any of your moles develop any one of the above signs you should contact your doctor immedi- ately as early detection and removal of a melanoma can be life saving. Other minor warning signs to look out for in a mole or a freckle are as follows: • Itch • Size greater than the head of a pencil (i.e. >7 mm) • Bleeding or crusting • Inflammation. Non-melanoma skin cancers—These include basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). SCCs grow slowly and rarely spread beyond the skin unless they are neglected for a long time. BCC’s almost never spread beyond the skin so they are not usually fatal. However, they can spread locally within the skin and cause troublesome ulcers or damage local structures such as the eyes, ears or lips. The warning signs to look out for are as follows: • A new growth on the skin, which appears for no apparent reason. • A sore or an ulcer that will not heal after 2–4 weeks. • A persistent isolated scaly patch on the skin that does not clear up with topical creams. Many people just notice a bump that looks like a mosquito bite but does not heal. It grows slowly and sometimes bleeds when scrubbing with the towel. If you have any of these warning signs please get your doctor to check your skin. 616 D. Buckley 66.6.5 Warning signs for melanoma • A mole that suddenly gets bigger in size (diameter) or you develop a brand new mole on your skin that continues to grow. (Change in size) • The mole develops a ragged or uneven outline (moles are normally round or oval and have a smooth edge). (Change in shape) • The mole develops a mixture of different shades of brown, black or other colours through it (nor- mal moles usually have only one colour and the colour does not change over time) (Change in colour) • The mole looks completely different than the rest. (“the ugly duckling sign”) • The mole becomes red or inflamed around the edges. • The mole starts bleeding, oozing or crusting. • The mole starts to feel different, for example, slightly itchy or painful. • Not all melanomas are brown or black—they may be flesh coloured, red or pink. Any new or changing lesion on the skin that you cannot explain needs to be checked by a doctor with experi- ence in dermatology. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 617 66.7 Skin Surgery 66.7.1 Anticoagulants and surgery-patient information If you are taking blood thinners prior to surgery please discuss whether you need to stop, reduce or delay your dose with your surgeon. We normally recommend the following: Aspirin (ASA) is often taken by patients without clear indication (e.g. post heart attack or stroke or post-stenting or bypass surgery) in which case it can be stopped 10–14 days before surgery. Otherwise it is unlikely to cause significant bleeding problems in isolation at 75–300 mg daily. If you are having medium or high risk skin surgery discuss with your GP if it is safe to stop your aspirin 10–14 days before your surgery for full reversal or 5 days for 50% efficacy. Restart 7 days post-surgery. Clopidogrel (“Plavix”®) cause prolonged oozing. Postpone surgery until off drug if possible (e.g. sometimes used for 1 year post cardiac stinting or bypass). If you are having a high bleeding risk procedure ask the cardiologist’s or GP’s advice regarding the risk of stopping clopidogrel for 7 days before your surgery and if a substitute alternative drug should be used while off the drug. Restart 7 days after your surgery. Warfarin: Stopping or avoiding warfarin is not usually justified. Check INR bloods 72 h before your surgery. The bleeding risk is very small if the INR is <3.5 for low risk procedures. For medium or high risk procedures aim for an INR of 2–2.5 if the therapeutic range allows for the reason you are taking warfarin. Take advice from your GP or haematology if INR reduction needed. Novel Oral Anticoagulants/Direct Acting Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs/DOACS) • E.g.: apixaban (“Eliquis®” 2.5–5 mg BD), dabigatran (“Pradaxa®” 15 mg BD), edoxaban (“Lixiana®” 60 mg OD), rivaroxaban (“Xarelto®” 15–20 mg OD) • For low risk cutaneous surgery procedures*: • Perform the procedure just before the next dose is due or • Perform the procedure approximately 18–24 h after the last dose. The drug can be restarted 6 h post-surgery. This means one dose of a drug taken twice a day (e.g. “Eliquis®” or “Pradaxa®”) may be missed. For once a day drugs (e.g. Xarelto® or Lixinana®) take the daily dose 6 h post-surgery on the day of the surgery. • For moderate risk cutaneous surgery procedures*: • Check with the prescriber (e.g. cardiologist) and consider stopping the drug 24 h before the procedure. • For high risk cutaneous surgery procedures*: • Check with the prescriber (e.g. cardiologist) and consider stopping the drug 48 h before the procedure. * Further dose adjustments may be required for patients with poor kidney function. NSAIDs Stop three days before your surgery and for 7 days post-surgery if possible for moderate and high risk procedures. 618 D. Buckley Herbal Remedies and Supplements Examples include (but are not restricted to): Garlic, Ginger, Ginkgo, Ginseng, Saw Palmetto, Fish Oil (e.g. cod liver), Camomile or Feverfew. Many can promote bleeding (and other relevant effects). This is only likely to be significant for patients who are on other blood thinners or those at high risk from post-operative bleeding. Discontinuation of all supplements (including herbal teas) at least 2 weeks before your surgery. Risk Stratification for Skin Surgery Procedures Low risk procedures – Curettage – Punch biopsy – Incisional biopsy—scar length <10 cm – Excision and direct closure on trunk, limbs or compressible head and neck sites (scar length <10 cm) – Joint injection – Cryosurgery Moderate risk procedures – Excision and direct closure on non-compressible areas (neck, lip, genitals) – Wide excision and direct closure on trunk and limbs – Secondary intention wounds on compressible sites – Grafts on compressible sites (and split thickness graft donor sites) – Small local flaps (e.g. rhombic on nose, or wedge or helical rim advancement on ear) – Ingrown toenails High risk procedures – Secondary intention wounds on non-compressible sites – Excision within the orbit (e.g. eyelids) – Where bone is involved – Local flaps on head and neck with wide undermining (e.g. forehead, periocular—especially orbital, cheek, large nose flaps, neck) – Local interpolated flaps (e.g. paramedian forehead flap) – Wide excision and direct closure on non-c ompressible sites (e.g. neck) – Grafts on non-compressible sites 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 619 66.7.2 Care of your wound after surgery • Wounds on the face are usually left open. Other wounds may be covered with a light dressing or band-aid for the first few days. Provided they are dry, they can then be left open, which makes it easier to inspect them. • You can bath or shower after surgery and get the wound wet. However do not rub or scrub over the wound until it is fully healed. If you have had steri-strips (paper strips) placed on the wound, you must keep them dry for at least 7 days. • Your doctor or practice nurses will tell you when the stitches need to be removed. Stitches on the face are left in for approximately 5–7 days. Stitches on the body and scalp are usually left in for 7–10 days. Stitches on the leg are usually left in for up to 2 weeks. • Sometimes wounds will bleed after surgery. If this happens after going home please put firm pres- sure on the wound for ten consecutive minutes using some kitchen towel, tissue paper or clean cloth. Bleeding from the arms or legs can be further controlled by elevating the limb as high as possible. If this does not control the bleeding you should contact your doctor or nurse immediately. • Surgical wounds sometimes become infected. This is usually signified by pain, redness around the wound, a smelly discharge, a pussy discharge and a wound that is getting worse rather than better as the days go by. If you have any of these suspicious signs and you are worried please contact your doctor or practice nurses immediately as antibiotics by mouth at any early stage can prevent more serious infection. Infections may be prevented by bathing the wound in an antisep- tic solution daily till the would heals. After drying the wound, apply some antiseptic cream which can help keep the wound free of infection. • Scars can take 9 to 18 months to fully blend into the skin. Daily massaging with ‘’Bio Oil” can help fade a scar. However, scars on the upper chest, back and upper arms tend to become stretched after 9 or 18 months and can sometimes leave a rather unsightly scar. This stretching of scars is unusual in other sites. Very occasionally a person may develop a “keloid scar” which is an unsightly, thickened, lumpy, deep red scar. Keloid scars are a sign of excessive wound healing and happens in a small percentage of patients. Although difficult to manage, there are treatments that can improve the cosmetic appearance of keloid scars. • If you have had surgery on your foot or leg you should go home immediately after the operation and lie out on the couch with your foot up on the armrest at the far end of the couch and keep it as elevated as possible (at least 30 degrees above horizontal) for the remainder of the day. Do not swim in a pool or partake in any strenuous exercise until the wound is fully healed (usually 2–4 weeks). • If you have had surgery on the face or around the eyes, you can expect considerable swelling or bruising which can take 1–2 weeks to subside. Sometimes an eye can become swollen and closed after surgery but this usually resolves after 5 or 7 days. If you think the swelling is due to infection, please contact your doctor or nurse. • If you have had some tissue sent to the lab for histology, please phone back in 2–3 weeks’ time for the results. 620 D. Buckley 66.7.3 Cryosurgery clinic 1. Liquid Nitrogen Cryosurgery is an extremely effective treatment for the destruction of unwanted tissues like verrucae, warts, certain types of skin cancers and other skin growths, with minimal scar formation. Occasionally, there may be residual discoloration in the treated area. This is usu- ally temporary, but it can take several months for the normal skin colour to return. Occasionally you may be left with permanent light or dark discoloration of the skin. 2. Liquid Nitrogen is extremely cold (–196° centigrade). Its application causes rapid freezing to produce an instant and intense frostbite, the extent of which can be accurately controlled. For larger lesions your doctor may use a topical or local anaesthetic (like a dental anaesthetic) to numb the area before treatment. 3. There may be some pain or discomfort at the time of treatment and for a few hours afterwards. This seldom needs more than Paracetamol or ibuprofen. Paracetamol can be taken every 4 h but not more than four doses in 24 h. For severe pain take the maximum dose according to your age and alternate Paracetamol with Ibuprofen every 3 h in the first 18 h post cryosurgery. If necessary Paracetamol and ibuprofen can be taken at the same time. 4. The treated site and surrounding skin may swell within a few minutes and a blister may develop within a few hours or a day or two later. The blister may be filled with clear or blood stained fluid. Burst the blister with a sterile pin and squeeze out the fluid. The swelling will then get smaller and a scab will form. 5. For as long as the wound is oozing, clean it daily with an antiseptic wash. Wash gently, pat dry and apply a dry dressing or an antiseptic cream. Bleeding occasionally occurs and can usually be controlled by elevating the bleeding site and applying firm pressure with some padding and a firm bandage. 6. Once a scab has formed, leave open to the air. Wait for it to fall off, which it will do when the underlying skin has healed. 7. Areas frozen on the face may result in swelling of the eyelids and/or cheeks. No special treatment is required, as it always goes down in a few days. 8. Healing time after liquid nitrogen treatment varies from 2 to 8 weeks and may be longer on some parts of the body, such as the legs and feet. Wounds occasionally get infected and this may cause heat, redness, swelling and a smelly, pussy discharge, with pain that gets worse rather than better as the days post treatment pass by. If you think the wound is infected, please contact your doctor or nurse immediately as you may need an antibiotic. 9. Areas frozen on the scalp, forehead and temples may occasionally produce a dull headache. Paracetamol is usually all that is required. 10. If you have any worries or problems following the freezing treatment, do not hesitate to contact your doctors or nurse. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 621 66.8 Sun Protection 66.8.1 Be safe in the sun Ten Rules for People with Fair or Sensitive Skin and Those with Sun Damage 1. Cover up in the sunny weather—wear a broad rimmed cotton or felt (not a loosely woven straw) hat that covers your face, ears and the back of your neck. Wear a long sleeved shirt and long trou- sers or a long dress. 2. Put a total sun block on the exposed skin (e.g. face, ears, neck, hands and feet). Choose a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or greater (i.e. the amount of UVB blockage). UVA protection fac- tor must be at least one-third of the labelled SPF so choosing a sunscreen with a higher SPF will also mean high UVA protection. 3. Avoid going out in the middle of the day (11 a.m.–3 p.m.) when the sun is most dangerous. 4. Remember that you can get sun damage even on cloudy days (70% of the damaging sun rays will penetrate through clouds, through glass and water). 5. Take care to protect your skin from the sun all year round, not just the summer months. Be extra careful when overseas in sunny countries. 6. Never use a sun bed. 7. Remember there is no such thing as a “safe tan”. Tanning is a sign of skin damage. However, fake tans are safe but you still have to use all the above precautions (i.e. total sun blocks and protective clothing) when in the sun. 8. Too much sun (or sun beds) can cause skin cancer especially in people who have sensitive skin. Excessive sun exposure (or sun beds) will also prematurely age the skin and cause wrinkles. 9. Beware of a cooling breeze, especially on a cloudy day when out walking, golfing, gardening or on a boat as it may temporarily mask the burning effects of the sun rays which may be hidden by the clouds. 10. If you are being sun smart to protect your skin from ultra violet light you should consider taking a vitamin D supplement especially in the winter months (approximately 800 IU or 20 μg per day) as the sun shining on our skin is our principal source of vitamin D. 622 D. Buckley 66.8.2 The Sun and Vitamin D Advice for People Using Sun and Ultraviolet Light Protection to Guard Against Sunburn, Redness, Wrinkles and Skin Cancer Vitamin D is essential for healthy bones as it allows calcium to be absorbed in the gut. The recommended daily intake of Vitamin D for adults is 400 IU (10 mg). However, some doctors recommend twice this amount (i.e.: 400–800 IU or 10–20 ug per day). People with kidney disease, kidney stones or sarcoidosis should have their vitamin D and calcium levels monitored regularly. Sunlight is a good source of Vitamin D. Using sun protection may result in Vitamin D deficiency unless you maximise your source of Vitamin D from your diet and you take Vitamin D supplements. Rich sources of Vitamin D include the following: • Oily fish, such as herrings, kippers, sardines, mackerel, salmon and tuna (at least once or twice a week). • Fortified foods such as HiLo Milk or Avonmore Supermilk • Fortified margarines • Eggs (seven per week or four per week of you have high cholesterol) However, it is difficult to consume sufficient Vitamin D from diet alone. Other good sources of Vitamin D are Vitamin D supplements such as “Adult D 1000®” by Shield Health, “BabyVitD3®” by KoRa (0.4 ml/day for adults = 400 IU/day), “D Lux spray®” by BetterYou (1000 IU/spray), “D-Pearls®” by Pharma Nord (1520 IU/capsule), “Desunin®” 800 IU and Boots® VitD 25 mg. You can also get a once monthly oral dose (“Thorens 25,000 IU®” once per month). By taking sufficient dietary Vitamin D, there is no need to rely on sunlight or daylight as a source of Vitamin D, so it is safe to use total sunblocks, hats and appropriate clothing to protect your skin from damaging ultraviolet light rays. In addition to taking extra dietary vitamin D, people who need to protect their skin from ultraviolet light should also take plenty of calcium to maintain good bones and teeth. Adults need at least 700 mg/ day. The best source of calcium is from dairy products (milk, cheese, yoghurt). Other sources of calcium include the following: • Sardines • Green leafy vegetables including spinach and broccoli, baked beans and red kidney beans • Nuts and seeds • Soya bean curd People who do not take regular dairy produce may need to take a calcium supplement every day. Some supplements have both calcium and vitamin D (e.g.: “Calcichew D3 Forte®”, “Caltrate®”, “Ideos®” and “Osteofos D3®”) To maintain healthy bones you should also do some weight-bearing exercises (e.g. brisk walking, jogging, dancing, tennis, golf etc.) for 40 min at least three times a week. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 623 66.9 Miscellaneous 66.9.1 Advice for patients with varicose ulcers • Don’t stand for long periods • Whenever possible, sit or lie down with your leg elevated • Take exercise regularly. Walking is good, standing is bad. • If unable to walk, exercise your calf muscles by bending your ankle up and down for 5 min every hour while your leg is elevated • Don’t wear garters or stockings which have tight elasticised tops • If overweight, lose some pounds • Don’t smoke • You will need high compression stockings or compression bandaging applied regularly provided you have good circulation to your feet. • When your ulcer is healed, wear medical compression stockings which have been recommended by your doctor for the rest of your life. • Put these stockings on before getting out of bed in the morning and only take them off last thing at night when you are getting into bed • Do no rub anything onto the skin on your legs or ulcers unless it has been recommended by your doctor. When showering, use a soap free wash or syndets. • Emulsifying ointment or Paraffin gel rubbed downwards is a safe moisturiser and can be used as a soap substitute • Eat a healthy balanced diet with plenty of lean red meat, oily fish, green leafy vegetables, and fresh fruit. • Have a blood test with your doctor to ensure you have no underlying problems that may slow up the healing of your ulcer. 624 D. Buckley 66.9.2 Hyperhydrosis • Keep cool, avoid hot fires, overheated cars, too much clothes, hot spicy foods, alcohol or anything else that makes you sweat. For more information see: www.hyperhidrosisuk.org (a UK website) or www.sweathelp.org (a USA website). • Keep calm, avoid stress (if possible) and try not to rush. • Wear lose fitting cotton clothing. White and black shirts are better at hiding sweat stains. Wear leather soled shoes or open sandals. Consider absorbent insoles for your shoes. (www.simplyfeet. co.uk) Consider disposable axillary soak pants (www.extremeclothingprotectors.co.uk). Consider clothing impregnated with silver or copper which reduces sweat and odour (www.buyinconfidence. com or www.silversocks.co.uk or www.ccuxsongerrard.com or www.esteemclothingprotectors. co.uk). For sports, wear fabrics that take moisture away from the skin. • Shower regularly and avoid soaps. Use a soap free wash such as aqueous cream, Elave wash, Aveeno wash, etc. • Use antiperspirants combined with deodorants twice a day. • If regular antiperspirants from the supermarket do not work try special ones containing aluminium chloride which can be bought without prescription from your pharmacist or on line (“Driclor®”, “Anhydrol Forte®”, “Sweat Stop®”). Follow the instructions carefully on the box. • If aluminium chloride antiperspirants are irritating the skin try a weaker version (e.g. www.sweat- stop.co.uk) or apply a topical steroid to the area in the morning after washing off the antiperspirant for the first 2 weeks. • For more severe sweating of the hands or feet consider buying a home iontophoresis machine which is made up of two trays containing water and a light electrical current. You place your hands or feet in the trays for 20–30 min every other day initially and less frequently as the sweating reduces. (www.iontophoresis.info). • For resistant hyperhidrosis in the armpits consider “Botox®” which is extremely effective but expensive. It reduces sweating under the armpits by 70–100% and can last from 4 to 8 months but can be expensive. For excessive sweating on the face consider weaker versions of aluminum chloride (www.sweatstop.co.uk) • For very severe sweating, especially if generalised or not responding to the above methods, talk to your doctor about oral prescription medication such as anticholinergics, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers which can be extremely effective. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 625 66.9.3 Keratosis Pilaris Keratosis pilaris is a very common finding on the outer aspect of the upper arms and cheeks in chil- dren and teenagers. It may run in families. Sometimes keratosis pilaris occurs on the thighs too, rarely elsewhere. It may occur in babies where it tends to be most obvious on the cheeks. It may remain for years but generally becomes less obvious in adult life; keratosis pilaris is uncommon in elderly people. Keratosis pilaris tends to be more severe during the winter months or other times of low humidity when the skin dries out. There are numerous tiny rough spots in the affected area. Each one is a horny plug, sometimes rather red but only rarely itchy and never sore. When keratosis pilaris occurs on the cheeks, very often the affected areas are red as well as feeling rough. When the outer eyebrows are affected the condition is known as “ulerythema oophryogenes”. Keratosis pilaris is completely harmless but sometimes unsightly. It occurs because as the skin renews itself, old skin cells in the hair follicles get stuck, forming a scaly plug. Treatment: Some people find the following useful: • Moisturising cream applied twice a day—try those containing urea (e.g. “Eucerin®” or “Calmurid®”—10% on the body and 3% on the face or “Uriage Keratosane 30®” = 30% urea for arms or legs) • Alphahydroxy acids. • Rubbing with a pumice stone or a “Buf-Puf®” in the shower or bath • Vitamin A derivatives such as tretinoin (“Isotrex®”) or adapalene (“Differin®”), which are prescrip- tion gel or cream. For the first few weeks of treatment, redness and peeling of the treated areas can be expected. Vitamin A derivatives must not be used in pregnancy. 626 D. Buckley 66.9.4 Methotrexate Information • MTX is used to treat different types of psoriasis and should be used with care as one of its actions is to reduce the activity of the immune system. It may take several weeks before the skin improves. • MTX is usually taken once a week with food, starting with a low dose such a 5 mg or 7.5 mg, which may be increased if necessary. • As MTX can affect the blood count and sometimes causes liver damage, patients should have regu- lar blood tests while on treatment. • Side-effects of MTX include a feeling of nausea, rashes and mouth ulcers. It can cause a reduction in the number of blood cells that are made, which can make the patient more liable to infection. Your doctor should be informed of a sore throat or other infection, a fever, unexplained bleeding or bruising or breathlessness. • Patients who have not had chickenpox and come into contact with either chickenpox or shingles should inform your doctor immediately, as special treatment may be indicated. If the patient devel- ops chickenpox or shingles, your doctor should be informed immediately and MTX stopped until the spots have scabbed over when it can be restarted. • Some drugs can interact with MTX to cause problems. Special care is needed with NSAID’s which are used to treat arthritis. These and other over-the-counter medication should not be purchased without discussion with the physician. • Alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage with MTX and should be avoided. • MTX should not be taken during pregnancy. Both men and women must take contraceptive precau- tions while talking MTX and for 6 months after treatment is stopped. • Immunisation with live vaccines such as polio and rubella (German measles) should be avoided while taking MTX. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 627 66.9.5 Pruritis Ani Puritus Ani is itching around the opening of the back passage or anus. It is a common problem. Although it is seldom caused by serious disease, it can be very trouble- some and frustrating. Most cases are caused by irritation from hairy buttocks rubbing against each other, which is further aggravated by the irritating effect of sweat and leakage of faecal material. This irritation must be reduced to allow the problem to settle. General Advice • Clean the anus carefully after bowel movements—use unbleached or minimally processed toilet paper or a wet flannel. Pat gently. Avoid baby wipes. • Use a soap free wash or aqueous cream in place of soap for washing. • This leaves a protective layer on the skin and avoids the irritant effect of soap. Use your fingers— not a flannel. • Wear loose, soft cotton underwear. Avoid any tight clothing that keeps the buttocks pressed together, such as tight jeans. Free circulation of air is important. Do not use softeners when wash- ing your underwear. • Wear pyjamas. • Eat a high fibre diet with plenty of cereals, fruit and vegetables. This avoids straining when passing a bowel motion, which can lead to haemorrhoids (piles) and constipation. These can lead to cracks in the anus. • Lose weight, if appropriate, as obesity reduces ventilation of the perianal skin. • Apply any prescribed medication carefully at bedtime (e.g. “Daktacort®” or “Protopic®”) • Apply Zinc and Castor Oil or “Vaseline®” regularly during the day and before exercise as this acts as a lubricant and barrier cream. Avoid Aggravating Factors • Do not apply any other anti itch, pain relieving, or numbing creams, ointments or suppositories to your anus unless recommended by your doctors as it may cause an allergic rash. Avoid potent topi- cal steroids. • Do not use any bath additives such as bubble bath, “Radox®” or aromatherapy oils as these can irritate the delicate skin around the anus. • Do not apply talcum powder, as this tends to coalesce into small lumps in the crevices. • Do not eat spicy foods, such as chillies, or irritant foods, such as nuts and popcorn. Other foods that may cause problems include citrus fruit, tomatoes, pork, and excess beer or caffeine (coffee and tea). • Try not to open your bowels more than once or twice per day. Frequent bowel motions are usually soft or fluid and cause more irritation. Remember: Puritus Ani can be a stubborn condition that often needs months of careful treatment. Try not to scratch! 628 D. Buckley 66.9.6 Tinea Versicolor Treatment • Apply KETACONAZOL lotion (“Nizoral Shampoo®”) to the dry skin at night and wash it out after 15 min. • Apply the lotion from your neck down to your upper thighs and down as far as your wrists being careful to cover ALL areas in between, front and back. • Apply the lotion for 15 min every night for 1 week. This will get rid of any itch or scaliness. • After this treatment you may be left with a faint rash. This will gradually fade away over a few weeks after finishing the treatment especially after getting some sun. • Do NOT continue the treatment indefinitely. • The rash may recur during the summer or after a “sun holiday”. If this occurs simply treat your- self again as outlined above. Some people need to treat themselves every spring to prevent get- ting a “blotchy” tan in the summer. • Remember, it is a safe and effective treatment. • If you have any problems please contact your doctor. 66 Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) 629 66.9.7 Top ten self-care tips for people with psoriasis 1. Moisturise liberally with a safe, greasy moisturiser at least twice a day. 2. Avoid dark clothes as they will show off dandruff and silvery scale. 3. Avoid excessive alcohol (keep to less than 14 units per week) and do not smoke. 4. If you are overweight, try to lose some. 5. Try a ‘’Mediterranean diet” for at least 3 months. Take oral Omega 3 capsules daily 6. Get plenty aerobic exercise. 7. Ask your doctor to check your cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure annually if you are over 45 years old. 8. Remind yourself and everyone else that psoriasis is not contagious. 9. Try a to stay positive; psoriasis is not usually life-threatening. 10. Carefully follow the instructions about your treatment from your doctor or nurse. If you are unsure, ask questions. 67 Useful Websites, Courses, Bibliography and Patient Support Groups David Buckley The following is a list of useful websites and skin conditions, provides patient information, resources: self help materials and support services; www.skinsupport.org.uk 67.1 General Dermatology Changing Faces: Resources for Patients Changing Faces supports adults, children and families living with disfigurement; Irish Skin Foundation: www.changingfaces.org.uk Information on common skin problems such as eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, hidradenitis suppura- NHS Dermatology Patient Information: tiva, melanoma and other types of skin cancer www.uhb.nhs.uk/pi- dermatology.htm and for patients; www.irishskinfoundation.ie Patient Info: www.patient.info—a UK bases site on informa- British Skin Foundation: tion on numerous health-related topics includ- Get people sharing their experience with one ing various skin problems. another so they don’t have to suffer in silence; www.britishskinfoundation.org.uk Psoriasis: Adults: The British Association of Dermatologists: • Psoriasis Association: British Association of Dermatologists has com- www.psoriasis- association.org.uk prehensive list of patient support groups; • Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Alliance: www.bad.org.uk/for-t he-p ublic/patient- www.papaa.org/resources supportgroups • Irish Skin Foundation/Psoriasis: www.irishskinfoundation.ie Skin Support: Teenagers: British Association of Dermatologists website to • Psoteen: support people in psychological distress due to www.psoteen.org.uk Eczema: National Eczema Society (UK) Providing D.
